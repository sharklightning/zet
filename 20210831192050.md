# creating users

creating a new user:
`adduser <user>` runs a perl script that helps you to create a new user easily: 
```
root@a5db6a709628:/# adduser thomas
Adding user `thomas' ...
Adding new group `thomas' (1001) ...
Adding new user `thomas' (1001) with group `thomas' ...
Creating home directory `/home/thomas' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password: 
Retype new password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for thomas
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
	Full Name []: Tom
	Room Number []: 
	Work Phone []: 
	Home Phone []: 
	Other []: 
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y  
```

Now if we look at `grep home` from our `/etc/passwd` we can see what users on the system:
```
root@a5db6a709628:/# grep home /etc/passwd
thomas:x:1001:1001:Tom,,,:/home/thomas:/bin/bash
```
This tells us there is one user on the system with username `thomas`. 
`x` tells us that there is no password stored for this user in /etc/passwd (it is stored in another secret file which we will learn about later).
`1001:1001` tells us that `thomas` is user 1001 of group 1001.
`Tom,,,` is just a random text field containing the answers to all the questions the adduser script asked us
`home:thomas` indicates the user's home directory
`/bin/bash` indicates the users shell

Once user is created, use `su - <user> to login as that user.

The harder way to create a user is `useradd` 
```
root@a5db6a709628:/# useradd another
root@a5db6a709628:/# grep home /etc/passwd
thomas:x:1001:1001:Tom,,,:/home/thomas:/bin/bash
another:x:1002:1002::/home/another:/bin/sh
```
Note 
* `useradd` does not provide an interactive script to setup your new user
* the default shell is `sh`

Even though `useradd` made an entry in `/etc/passwd` assuming that `/home/another` is the new users home directory, it did not actually make this home directory for you. If you try to log in to `another` you will see there is actually no home directory:
```
root@a5db6a709628:/# su - another
su: warning: cannot change directory to /home/another: No such file or directory
```
If you want `useradd` to create a home directory when creating a user you can denote this with the `-m` flag, which builds a home directory from the contents of /etc/skel:
```
root@a5db6a709628:/# cd /etc/skel 
root@a5db6a709628:/etc/skel# ls -la
