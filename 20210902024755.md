# more on permissions

`root` access
use `sudo` to grant `root` access
use `sudo su -` to get root shell
use `doas -` to execute a single command as root

## file permissions and directory ownership

The most common types of files you will see are files, links, directories, and executables.

```
rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ ls -l
total 8
lrwxrwxrwx 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom    4 Sep  2 03:00 another -> file
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom    0 Sep  2 02:58 file
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom   21 Sep  2 03:02 hello
drwxrwxr-x 2 rtfmtom rtfmtom 4096 Sep  2 03:00 somedir
```

The `-rw-r--r--` here describes the file type and permissions.

The first space says whether it is a file `-`, a link `l`, or a directory `d`.

The next three spaces such as `rw-` or `rwx` indicate the user permissions. The middle three indicate the group permissions. The last three indicates "world" or "other" permissions. 

## umask
`umask` - display or set file-creation mmask to MODE
`umask [-p] [-S] [mode]`

i.e. "user mask" allows you to define default permissions for a users newly created files and folders

`umask` returns an octal (base-8) value, `umask -p` returns an octal value in a form that may be reused as input:
```
rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ umask -p
umask 0002
```

`umask -S` makes the output symbolic:
```
rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ umask -S
u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx
```
See [this webpage](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/what-is-umask) for further information. 

## changing permissions

It is possible to change permissions using octal values as in `chmod 775 hello` to make a file executable.

HOWEVER, it is safer for the inexperienced to use `chmod +x hello` or `chmod -x hello`, which changes all categories (user, group, and other) to either permit or not permit execution of the file:
```
rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ chmod +x hello
rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ ls -l
total 0
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom   21 Sep  2 03:02 hello

rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ chmod -x hello
rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom   21 Sep  2 03:02 hello
```

This is safer because permissions have a different meaning on directories than it does on files (so running `chmod 755` recursively on directories and files will not behave as you expect).

## more practice

Taking away "other" permissions for all files in a directory would look like this:
```
rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ ls -l
total 8
lrwxrwxrwx 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom    4 Sep  2 03:00 another -> file
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom    0 Sep  2 02:58 file
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom   21 Sep  2 03:02 hello
drwxrwxr-x 2 rtfmtom rtfmtom 4096 Sep  2 03:51 somedir

rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ chmod o-rwx *
rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ ls -l
total 8
lrwxrwxrwx 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom    4 Sep  2 03:00 another -> file
-rw-rw---- 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom    0 Sep  2 02:58 file
-rwxrwx--- 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom   21 Sep  2 03:02 hello
drwxrwx--- 2 rtfmtom rtfmtom 4096 Sep  2 03:51 somedir
```
Note that `chmod o-rwx` (the `o` is for "other") did not remove "other" permissions for the symbolic link `another`. Symbolic links always have full rwx permissions but nonetheless enforce the permissions of the file they link to.

For example if I were to login as different user and try to open `another` I would still get `Permission denied` error
```
rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ sudo su - newuser
[sudo] password for rtfmtom: 
$ cd /home/rtfmtom
$ ls
another  file  hello  somedir
$ more another
more: cannot open another: Permission denied
```
If I wanted to give `newuser` access to `another` without changing the "other" permissions I could add `newuser` to the `rtfmtom` group.

To give others only the ability to read a file (other=read): `chmod o=r hello`

To give myself and anyone in my group the ability to execute a file (user/group +execute): `chmod ug+x hello`

Now other users can read the contents of `hello` but cannot execute it:
```
rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ sudo su - newuser
[sudo] password for rtfmtom: 
$ cd /home/rtfmtom
$ ./hello
-sh: 4: ./hello: Permission denied
$ cat hello
#!/bin/sh
echo hello
```
Security Takeaway: Never put a password or a token in a regular file such as a script. 

Nowadays organizations are increasingly moving towards giving each user their own isolated container rather than managing a multi-user system.
