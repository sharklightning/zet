# more on ps and /proc

`ps` shows information about running processes.\
`-e` option: Display information about other users' processes, including those without controlling terminals.\
`-f` option: Display the uid, pid, parent pid, recent CPU usage, process start time, controlling tty, elapsed CPU usage, and the
             associated command.

we can `cd` into the `/proc` subdirectory for a process using its PID
```
rtfmtom@boost:~/repos/sharklightning/zet$ cd /proc/1312
rtfmtom@boost:/proc/1312$ ls
arch_status  clear_refs       cwd      gid_map    maps        net            pagemap      schedstat     stack    task            wchan

to see where the process executable was:
```
rtfmtom@boost:/proc/1312$ ls -l exe
lrwxrwxrwx 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom 0 Sep  3 06:52 exe -> /usr/bin/bash
```
to see where the process was running:
```
rtfmtom@boost:/proc/1312$ ls -l cwd
lrwxrwxrwx 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom 0 Sep  3 06:52 cwd -> /proc/1312
```
to see what was actually run:
```
rtfmtom@boost:/proc/1312$ cat cmdline
-bashrtfmtom@boost:/proc/1312$
```

If you have access you can read and write arbitrarily to the memory space of the process. \
That's how you hack things is by changing out the memory of a process that is running or about to be run.
