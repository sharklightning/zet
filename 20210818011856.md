# Debian almquist shell (dash)

Debian/ubuntu switched from `bash` to `dash` because `bash` was so heavy that it significantly slowed down start up times. The default on ubuntu is `dash` now
```
rtfmtom@boost:~$ ls -l /bin/sh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Jul 18  2019 /bin/sh -> dash
```

"Dash is an acronym for Debian Almquist shell (dash). It is a Unix and Linux shell which is much smaller than bash but still aiming at POSIX-compliancy. dash is a POSIX-compliant implementation of /bin/sh that aims to be as small as possible. "

"  Overview
     The shell is a command that reads lines
     from either a file or the terminal, in-
     terprets them, and generally executes
     other commands.  It is the program that
     is running when a user logs into the sys-
     tem (although a user can select a differ-
     ent shell with the chsh(1) command).  The
     shell implements a language that has flow
     control constructs, a macro facility that
     provides a variety of features in addi-
     tion to data storage, along with built in
     history and line editing capabilities.
     It incorporates many features to aid in-
     teractive use and has the advantage that
     the interpretative language is common to
     both interactive and non-interactive use
     (shell scripts).  That is, commands can
     be typed directly to the running shell or
     can be put into a file and the file can
     be executed directly by the shell.

   Invocation
     If no args are present and if the stan-
     dard input of the shell is connected to a
     terminal (or if the -i flag is set), and
     the -c option is not present, the shell
     is considered an interactive shell.  An
     interactive shell generally prompts be-
     fore each command and handles programming
     and command errors differently (as de-
     scribed below).  When first starting, the
     shell inspects argument 0, and if it be-
     gins with a dash '-', the shell is also
     considered a login shell.  This is nor-
     mally done automatically by the system
     when the user first logs in.  A login
     shell first reads commands from the files
     /etc/profile and .profile if they exist.
     If the environment variable ENV is set on
     entry to an interactive shell, or is set
     in the .profile of a login shell, the
     shell next reads commands from the file
     named in ENV.  Therefore, a user should
     place commands that are to be executed
     only at login time in the .profile file,
     and commands that are executed for every
     interactive shell inside the ENV file.
     To set the ENV variable to some file,
     place the following line in your .profile
     of your home directory

           ENV=$HOME/.shinit; export ENV

     substituting for ".shinit" any filename
     you wish.

     If command line arguments besides the op-
     tions have been specified, then the shell
     treats the first argument as the name of
     a file from which to read commands (a
     shell script), and the remaining argu-
     ments are set as the positional parame-
     ters of the shell ($1, $2, etc).  Other-
     wise, the shell reads commands from its
     standard input."
