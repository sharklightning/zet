## Inside the PC
  * motherboard - primary device that connects the innards of the system unit
    * has power connections on it that gives power to everything inside the system
    * RAM stick - goes on the motherboard
    * CPU
    * primary storage (such as an M2 SSD)
    * connectors for additional hard drives
    * expansion slots (such as PCIe) - give PCs a lot of flexibility, you can buy expansion cards that allow you to connect components that didn't come with the system unit like a video card
    * Chipset - defines what features the motherboard can support how many usb ports it can have, how many hard drives it can support, how many PCIe slots, etc
    * front panel connectors - control the on/off switch, reset button, etc

## what is a computer?
* CPU - basically a high speed calculator that processes programs to manipulate peripherals and create files to get things done
* Mass Storage - stores data and programs that are not in use
* RAM - when a program is running, it is stored in RAM
* Operating System - a program that runs all the other programs
* What is a CPU?
  * Central Processing Unit
  * External data bus - 8 light bulbs visible outside, 8 visible inside; used to communicate binary data to the CPU
    * 8 bits = a bite
  * Machine language - is the codebook in every CPU that tells it how to interpret the bit patterns
  * Registers - every CPU has registers (sometimes hundreds of them), each with it's own light bulbs (up to 128 bits across) to store values that are being calculated by the CPU 
  * Clock - the clocks job is to tell the CPU to zero everything outside and accept the next code value (i.e. command) from the external data bus or output the result of a calculation to the external bus
  * Pipeline (aka a core) - basically an assembly line of different steps used to optimize the processing commands (modern CPUs can up to 16 or 30 steps)
    * prefetch - decides what to do with the command, who to pass it to
    * integer math
    * long numbers
    * cache 

## CPUs and Cores
* CPUs are described using make, model and speed (eg. AMD Ryzen 4 GHz)
* CPU clock speed is measured in GHz
  * 1 Hertz = 1 time per second
  * 1 GHz = 1 billion times per second
* Intel or AMD
  * have the exact same codebases inside, they speak the same code language
* every motherboard on earh has a system crystal (a quartz oscillator) which acts as a metronome for the whole computer
* clock multiplying - even the most advanced motherboards today can only run around 200-400 MHz (i.e. megaHertz or million Hertz), so how does the CPU achieve GHz speeds? It takes the beat coming from the system crystal and multiply it; these multipliers are actually built into the CPU itself
* check out the program CPUID CPU-Z
  * Microarchitecture = the name of the design of the CPU system itself
  * Max TDP = maximum amount of wattage it will take
  * Bus Speed = the speed of the system clock (in MHz)
  * Multiplier = how much the clock is being multiplied
* ways to speed up a CPU
  * Overclocking - done by enthusiasts, pushes the system to go faster by cranking the clock up
  * Hyper-Threading - one pipeline that can handle multiple incoming peices of code at the same time 

  * Multiple Cores - use miltiple pipelines at one time; each core acts like a full CPUs

## Caching
* a little bit of what you already have, put closer to you
* program is loaded from storage to RAM, and then individual lines of code are fed to the CPU; the problem is that the CPU is so much faster than RAM, so to solve this we put a little bit of RAM inside the CPU called SRAM that is much faster; then if prefetch gets a command that requires getting more data from memory, he will send that command to a cache until that data is retrieved so he can keep grabbing commands in the meantime
* caches are used to prevent pipeline stall, where an entire pipeline comes to a halt for several hundred clicks of the clock while it waits for a line of code from RAM
* one of the biggest differences between AMD and Intel is how they design cache
* there are 3 types of cache 
  * level 1 cache - runs at the same speed as the CPU (about 64k of memory)
  * level 2 cache (128-256k) - runs at about half the CPU speed and feeds the level 1 cache
  * level 3 cache (megabytes) - runs at about the base motherboard speed but much faster than RAM itself
* CPU Sockets
  * microarchitecture - essentially the circuit diagram of the CPU
  * Chip makers use family names to describe a single microarchitecture (eg. Intel's Coffee Lake microarchitecture) that they use to create a variety of different models of CPU (eg. i3, i5, i7, i9)
  * Coffee Lake i3 might have completely different architecture and sockets from Skylake i3 for example
* PGA vs LGA
  * Pin Grid Array vs LAN Grid Array
* Intel sockets
  * LGA 1151 - mainstream, middle of the road
  * LGA 2066 - enthusiast, higher end
* AMD sockets
  * AM4 - mainstream, middle of the road
  * TR4 - enthusiast, high end

## Summary of CPUs
The CPU has an internal code book that identifies each instruction pattern. A register is a memory location inside a CPU. The external data bus is the set of wires that carry data and instructions between the CPU and RAM. 

## RAM
* Every motherboard uses a particular kind of RAM
  * SDRAM - synchonized with the system clock, has two notches; speed is same as motherboard 
  * DDR SDRAM - double data rate SDRAM; for any single clock tick, gives 2 bits of information
  * DDR or PC speed ratings
    * DDR speed rating is double the clockspeed; PC rating is 8 times the DDR rating
  * DDR2 - doubles the DDR speed, 4 times faster than SDRAM; PC2 is 8 times the DDR2 rating
  * DDR3 - doubles DDR2; PC3 rating is 8 times the DDR3 rating
  * DDR4 - doubles DDR3; most common today; measured in MegaTransfers per second (bandwidth)
* RAM Capacity
  * RAM can be single or double sided RAM; some motherboards can't use double sided RAM
  * dual channel memory - many motherboards require two identical RAM sticks installed in particular slots to work
  * you can put different speed RAM in a seperate channel but this isn't recommended
  * however, there is no problem with putting different sized RAM in a separate channel
* RAM features
  * Parity or ECC (error correction code) RAM
    * tends to be seen in motherboards
    * protects if one (in the case of parity) or two (ECC) of the memory chips fails
  * SO-DIMM (small outline DIMMs)
    * just a smaller RAM chip, found in laptops often
  * SPD Chip (Serial Presense Detect)
    * allows the system to query the RAM chip and see how fast it's going, make and model, etc
    * you can use CPU-Z to do such queries

## What is the BIOS?
* The motherboard provides an interface for all the different hardware devices to connect to the CPU
* There are situations where the CPU needs to talk to these devices before the system even boots into an operating system (once in the OS, each OS will have it's own device drivers to manage I/O) 
* Basic Input/Output Services (BIOS) is a program burned onto a chip (firmware) that allows the CPU to communicate to the assumed hardware of the computer
* Most modern motherboards come with a backup BIOS in case one becomes corrupted
* Booting into BIOS is most commonly used to test if your CPU is capable of communicating with your assumed hardware (can it write to disk, output to a monitor, etc?)
* built into the BIOS is a Power On Self Test (POST), and a System Setup (CMOS)

## POST
* When power is supplied to the computer, the Power Good Wire starts the CPU which sends a signal to the BIOS to run the Power On Self Test (POST)
* POST sends a signal to all the hardware devices which report back if they are powered on and working correctly
* Once all devices including the CPU itself have reported back, the system unit emits a beep indicating that the test was successful
* If something is wrong and the video can't even display, POST gives beep codes to indicate the problem
* If we are able to get video, POST can present text errors
* If something goes so catastrophically wrong that POST can't even beep, you can turn to a POST Card, which a card you can plug into the system that will give a two digit hexadecimal readout
  * refer to the motherboard book Q-Code table to lookup these errors

## System Setup
* Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
  * technically UEFI has supplanted BIOS, but we still call it UEFI/BIOS or just BIOS
* BIOS is designed to talk to the assumed hardware of the computer, but this hardware changes and there might be security considerations that we want to implement; in that case, there is a seperate part of the BIOS that is called System Setup
* System Setup provides an interface for the user to change the changeable parts of BIOS
* Things you can change include:
  * language, date & time
  * Admin password is to access BIOS
  * User password to prevent unauthorized booting
  * system clock speed settings
  * onboard devices config: USB, sound cards, mass storage devices, network cards
  * boot config: enable or disable USB booting, boot priorities
  * flash updated firmware onto the BIOS chip (dangerous)

## troubleshooting firmware
* Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
  * used to be a seperate CMOS chip used to update the changeable parts of the BIOS firmware
* Today we use Single Flash ROM chips (Flash Memory)
  * it's Read Only Memory (ROM) but you can "flash" it if you want to update the firmware
* Real-Time Clock (RTC) - located inside the CMOS chip; really precise time is critical in networking
* every motherboard has a CMOS Battery built in to keep time, ensure preservation of BIOS settings
  * if your time is off by a weird amount or your custom BIOS settings disappear, it could be the CMOS Battery is going bad or died
  * CR2032 is the standard CMOS battery
* usually if your in System Settings and press F10 it will give you the option to Save or Cancel and exit without saving your changes
* Flashing Firmware
  * To avoid turning your motherboard into an ashtray, make sure to: 
    * have consistent power
    * have a complete BIOS Flash Image
    * make sure you know why you're doing it (maybe to accomodate a new, faster CPU)

## Motherboard Form Factor
* I/O area 
* ATX form factor is the most common
  * 12x9.6 inches
* Micro ATX form factor - 9.6 x 9.6
* Mini ITX - commonly used for small systems (home theater systems, POS systems)
* ITX - larger version of the mini ITX
* I/O sheild - every motherboard comes with it's own I/O sheild

## Chipsets
* Northbridge (traditionally interface to the CPU, had the memory controller, fast stuff). Southbridge (traditionally handles the slower stuff such as individual USB ports)
* Today modern CPUs handle all of the Northbridge functions, so modern motherboards typically only have a single Southbridge chipset
* When you buy a motherboard, you are actually buying a chipset because the chipset defines it's functionality
  * how much RAM, USB ports, hard drives, etc. that you can have
  * for any given CPU, there are many different chipsets you can buy with it
  * you should spend more time researching your chipsets than the CPU itself

## Touring the Motherboard
* SATA cables - used to connect hard drives or SSDs to the motherboard
* Power connectors - to supply electricity
* voltage regulators and capacitors - break down 12v, 5v, and 3v into dozens of voltages
  * flat capacitors are healthy, when they break they tend to dome/bubble up
  * PCIe expansion slots - graphics cards, etc
  * 16 lane PCIe connector
  * PCI was the precursor to PCIe, it was 32 bit wide bus and sent data in parrallel over the 32 wires
  * they discovered that it's actually faster to send 32 bits of data serially on one wire than in parrallel over 32, so when we went to PCIe they reduced that 32 bit capacity to a single wire called a lane, and made it go up to 16 lanes
  * you can take a single lane PCIe bus and plug it into a 16 lane connector with no problem
* USB connectors - connect to a dongle with USB connections on the end

## Touring the case
* Standout - the things on which we place the motherboard
* hard drive mounts -  3 1/4 inch hard drives, 2.5 inch drive
* Front connectors, USB, on/off switch - to be mounted on the motherboard
* fans

## Installing a motherboard
* mount your I/O shield, make sure your orientation is right
* when you drop the motherboard onto the standouts, make sure the I/O area lines up correctly with the I/O shield
* refer to motherboard and case documentation to determine where to plug in the front panel connectors, USB, on/off switch, fan connectors, etc

## Power supply
* ATX style power supply is the predominant kind of PC power supply today
* The ATX 12V power connectors (a 4/6/8 pin connector known as the P4 connector) send power to the CPU. The other devices get power from the main power connector
  * North America 110v, Europe 130v
  * on/off switch gives electricity, doesn't turn computer on/off
  * Power supply is actually a Step-down transformer - tranfsorms AC power to DC power
  * Has a ATX power connector - 20 pins and another peice with 4 pins
  * supplies 3 main types of voltage: 12v (yellow wire), 5v (red wire), 3.3v (orange wire)
  * ATX12V standards - extensions to the original ATX standard that allow us to supply more electricity to the motherboard; come have 8 connectors, some have 6 but can be plugged in on an 8 pin motherboard just fine
* Molex - oldest general purpose connector, still used as such
* mini connector 
* SATA power connection - hard drives, optical media 
* PCIe connector - video cards
* Modular Power Supply - allows you to choose what connectors you need

## Choosing a Power Supply
* wattage rating - how much wattage do you need is very subjective based on what components you are using; use an online wattage calculator and take your best guess + 10%; wattage rating tells you the maximum it can put out, not the amount it normally puts out
* efficiency - 60% efficiency would be good; a 575 watt rating will probably only be around 300 watts
* 80 plus rating system - gaurantees 80% or greater efficiency; use this to choose a power supply
* modular vs. soldered connections 
* Standard ATX size covers the vast majority of systems, but there are smaller power supplies out there for very very small form factor systems (they aren't on the exam)

## Cooling your PC
* Heat Sink - draws the heat from the CPU (or anything hot), and transfers it through hollow tubes and/or cooling fins, usually combined with fans to dissipate the heat
* If your system overheats, it will reboot
* PWM connectors - are 4 pin connectors that let the CPU manage it's own temperature
* other fan connectors have three pin slots but can be plugged into a PWM connector
* Most motherboards have functionality to manage temperature for you; but you can go into System Setup and set temperature warnings (check CPU manual to see max temp), fan fail warnings, CPU Fan Speed Control (set to normal usually)
* SpeedFan - free software tool to monitor and configure system unit fans
* For the vast majority of systems if you snap in the default fans it'll run fine with no problems

## troubleshooting power supplies
* will die really fast or really slow
  * if it burns fast it will often smell like burning, might be smoke
  * slow death is far more common and harder to diagnose; unexpected shut downs, or it won't turn on and then you unplug and replug it in and it works - the best way to tell is to test it
  * slow death is caused by capacitors going bad over time; can be tested using a power supply tester
* Multimeter V~ = AC
* V with three dots = DC

## Troubleshooting Core Components
* If a CPU has built in graphics, AMD calls it a APU; if it doesn't they call it a CPU. This is not the case with Intel, for whom all CPUs are called CPUs whether they have built in graphics or not
* On initial assembly, if the fans are turning and nobodies home, start over
  * good idea to test if the computer boots up with just the CPU, RAM, video card and power supply connected before installing the motherboard in the case
* System lockups after initial setup with just the core components - usually the result of making a screw up in System Setup; In that case find the Clear CMOS Jumper (looks like two little metal posts) and short them with a pair of car keys (touch them both for 30 seconds) and it will reset the System Setup to it's original defaults
* Indicator lights: front panel lights, motherboard LED lights (these aren't standardized, so use the manual to familiarize yourself)
* Be sure to check in System Setup that all the RAM you installed is showing up on your system
* It's possible to put in bad sticks of RAM, in this case, boot into a live USB Windows Recovery Environment or similar and run a memory diagnostic - just because your system sees it in System Setup doesn't necessairly mean it's good
* smoke coming out of the system - Unplug the system and find a fire extinguisher!
	  
## Storage
* Logical Block Addressing - each block = 4096 bytes; LBA allocates however many blocksa are needed to save a file; LBA acts as the device driver for all mass storage devices, so all you have to do is plug in any storage device and it can be accessed by the BIOS
* Capacities are measured slightly differently by manufacturers than by your Operating System:
* Metric (used by manufacturers)
  * 1000 = kilo
  * 1,000,000 = mega
  * 1,000,000,000 = giga
  * 1,000,000,000,000 = tera
  * 1,000,000,000,000,000 = peta
  * 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 = exa
* EIC counting (used by the OS):
  * 2^10 = 1024 kibi
  * 2^20 = mebi
  * 2^30 = gibi
  * 2^40 = tebi
* 5.25-inch mass storage - predates PCs, still used for optical media
* 3.5-inch - dominant form for many decades, high capacity hard drives
* 2.5-inch - originally for laptops but has become popular all around
* 1.8" - didn't catch on super well, found in some SSDs but was replaced by m.2-format
* m.2-format storage - for SSDs on most systems today
 
## Magnetic Disk Drive
* smallest unit of storage = sector
* HDD (Hard Disk Drive) has a spinning magnetic disk inside
* 3.5" and 2.5" are the most common HDD drives
* Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) is the language of the HDD used to communicate to LBA
* Serial ATA (SATA) is the interface used by modern HDD 
* HDDs have a SATA connector which is made up of a power connector and a data connector
* the other end of the SATA connector wire plugs into a SATA connector port on the motherboard
* eSATA Connector - a SATA connection that is designed to be used externally
  * eSATA is on the test despite not being used much anymore due to being largely superceded by advances in USB tech
* If your HDD shows up in System Setup, it's properly installed and nothing else needs to be done except boot into an OS and get it set up to use the HDD

## SSD
* On any SSD there will be a series of chips; within these chips are hundreds or thousands of "pages;" and a single page stores a bunch of "blocks" (the smallest unit)
  * 2.5" and m.2-format are the most common sizes of SSD
  * most 2.5" SSDs use normal SATA connectors
* many m.2-format drives use Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) instead of SATA; NVMe is much faster than SATA; if your m.2 has one notch it's NVMe, if it has two it's SATA
  * you need to make sure your motherboard has the right interface for NVMe
* NVMe uses PCIe lanes and is the fastest of these interface choices. PATA is the slowest; SATA and SCSI speeds fall between NVMe and PATA.
	
## SCSI
* In the old day, storage devices either used Parallel ATA connectors or a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
  * SCSI was developed about the same time as Parrallel ATA and was a competitor, they were incompatible
* today instead of using parrallel connections like ATA or SCSI, we use Serial ATA (which uses the same language as Parallel ATA but using a serial connection rather than parrallel wires)
* the same thing happened with SCSI years ago, today we have Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)
  * Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) uses the SATA connector with the SCSI command language
* ISCSI - connects SCSI devices via ethernet cable 
* the only place you will see SCSI anymore is on servers, but it is on the exam

## Boot Order
* after performing a Power On Self Test, the system looks for a storage device with an installed operating system from which to boot

## New Installation - First Drive
* how do you get that first drive partitioned and formatted? During installation

## RAID
* Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks
  * Provides speed and data redundancy
* RAID 0 (Striping)
  * requires minimum of 2 drives
  * splits the data across multiples drives, increasing speed
  * downside is there is no safety, any drive failure results in data loss
* RAID 1 (mirroring)
  * 2-4 drives
  * copies the same data to all drives
  * gives redundancy but at the cost of speed
* RAID 5 (parity)
  * min of 3 drives
  * uses same process of striping across 2 drives but creates a "parity" file saved on the third that can be used to recover the data if one of the drives fails
  * downside, you can only use 1 drive; losing more than 1 leads to data loss
* RAID 6 
  * minimum of 4 drives
  * creates 2 parities instead of 1
  * you can lose up to 2 drives before losing data
* RAID 1+0
  * striping mirrors
  * min 4 drives (two mirrored pairs)
  * make mirrors with one pair and then stripe it to the other mirrored pair
  * you can lose one of the mirrored pair on either side and your ok
  * downside is if you lose any complete pair you are pwned
* RAID 0+1
  * requires minimum of 2 pairs
  * create two pairs of striped disks and then mirror them
  * you can lose one complete striped pair and be ok
  * if you lose one on each side you lose data
* There are also proprietary RAID formats such as Synology's RAID arrays
* Summary
  * RAID 0 (striping) = speed
  * RAID 1 (mirroring) = redundancy
  * RAID 5 & 6 (striping with parity) = speed + redundancy
  * RAID 5 can only lose 1 drive; RAID 6 can lose 2

## Hardware RAID
* Many (>50%) of motherboards these days have a built in RAID controller soldered to the motherboard that configures the RAID array
* When using a hardware RAID controller, the entire RAID array shows up as a single drive letter in the Operating System
* AHCI vs. RAID Mode: In order to set this up we have to go into System Setup and tell the motherboard not to treat the array as AHCI drives (regular hard drives) and instead treat them as a RAID array
  * Hardware RAID has it's own BIOS, so once you switch to RAID Mode another System Setup is going to appear that allows you to configure the RAID array
* Hot spare /swappable drive - is a drive that automatically replaces any RAID drive that happens to fail in the array; you might need a fancier RAID controller to have a hot spare though!

## Mass Storage Troubleshooting
* Two rules when it comes to problems with mass storage
  1. Back it up!
  2. Mental reinstall - any problem especially with a new device, go back through the process of installing it in your head and you will probably remember the one step you missed
  3. Triple check! - most problems with mass storage are not due to them breaking but due to technician mistakes or configuration
* RAID not found/RAID not working
  * not found: probably never installed before; is the RAID controller active? do you have the right drivers for that particular system? If there is a RAID hardware System Setup can you get there? Make sure all drives are connected properly and have power
  * RAID stopped working: does the HD have power? is it plugged in? did somebody erase something you weren't anticipating? (always go through the mental reinstall)
* Read/write failure - tend to happen towards the end of a drives lifespan
  * S.M.A.R.T technology - built into all hard drives and allows us to query the drive using specialized tools to get a sense of the drives health
  * Solution: backup and replace the drive!
* Slow performance - probably not the drive itself; probably running out of RAM leading to a disk crash; can be indicated by the red/green read/write light on your drive going bananas
* Loud clicking - the click of death; terminal issue; if you're lucky you can get a backup; solution = replace the drive
* Failure to boot - usually due to a messed up boot order; WinRE will help you recover from boot failures
* Drive not recognized - usually a formatting problem; reformat the drive; the only time a working drive might suddenly show this error is if you are yankign a drive from one system and plugging it into another, and means that you need to initialize the disk before Windows will recognize it
* OS not found - 99% of the time you've messed up your boot order; go to System Setup and double check
* Attempts to boot incorrect device - boot order
* Continuous reboots - rarely due to an issue with storage, might be where you get corruption of the OS where it can't boot properly - refer to troubleshooting operating systems episode for about 50 answers to this problem
* Remember when dealing with drives that every drive runs off of a controller (SATA controller, RAID controller, USB controller, etc) - make sure the controller is turned on in System Setup

## Optical Media
* used since about 1980
  * Compact Disks (CDs)
    * read by a laser
    * originally for music
    * CD-ROM (CD-Read Only Memory)
      * CD File System (CDFS)
      * for data
    * CD-R (CD Recordable)
    * CD-RW (rewritable)
  * DVD (digital video disk)
    * digital versatile disk today
    * DVD-ROM holds data
      * most common type of optical media today
    * Dual-layer (DL) format
    * Dual-sided (DS)
    * DVD+R (burn once)
    * DVD+RW, DVD-RW
  * Blu-ray
    * Blu-ray ROM
    * standard disc, mini disc
    * BD-RE (recordable erasable)
* Optical Media Reader/Burner/everything
  * SATA data and power port on the back
  * Because it's an ATA device the OS will automatically recognize it

## USB Standards
* Universal Serial Bus (MEMORIZE THESE SPEEDS)
  * USB 1.0 (1,5 Mbps)
  * USB 1.1 (12 Mbps); white
  * USB 2.0 (480 Mbps); black
  * USB 3.0 (5 Gbps); blue
  * USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5 Gbps); blue

* USB connectors (VISUALLY MEMORISE THE FOLLOWING)
  * USB A connector
  * USB B connector
  * USB mini-B
  * USB micro-B
  * USB 3.0 micro-B
  * USB C
* USB is backward compatible

## Understanding USB
* USB controllers - built into the motherboard, usually inside the Southbridge, they control connected devices
  * There may be different controllers supporting different speed USB connections
  * All of these controllers connect to a single Root Hub which exposes all the USB ports on the motherboard so people can plug into them
  * Alternatively you might have seperate controllers plugged into seperate root hubs
* A connectors - connect the device to the controller, are called "downstream" connectors
* B connectors - connect to the device, and are called "upstream"
* In windows you can view the USB controllers and root hubs in the device manager

## Configuring USB
* As a rule, install device drivers before plugging in your peripheral and it will work
* In Windows, HID (human interface device) drivers are core device drivers that are there to always make sure that mice and keyboards work
  * if the device has extra features you will have to install specific device drivers to get that full functionality
* USB is a security issue (keyloggers, copying data, malware, etc)
  * solutions: disable USB ports in System Setup, USB lock (software)

## Thunderbolt and Lightning Connections
* Thunderbolt - kind of a combo of PCIe and DisplayPort into an all-in-one functionality port; drive monitors, charge, data transfer, etc
  * version 1 = 10 Gbits/s (x2 channels)
  * v 2 = 20 Gbits/s
  * v 3 = 40 Gbits/s
  * versions 1 and 2 use the same connector as DisplayPort
  * v 3 uses a USB C connector shape
  * MacOS uses Thunderbolt
* Lightning connectors
  * iOS proprietary connectors
  * iPhone/iPad etc. uses lightning
  * 5 Gbits/s

## Keyboards and Mice
* use either USB or PS/2 connection
* PS/2 connectors are making a comback among gamers due to lower latency
  * purple is for the keyboard, green is for the mouse
  * you have to restart the system after plugging in
* Game controllers
  * many will have a proprietary connection, you'll need a dongle to convert it to USB
* KVM Switch
  * allows you to have one set of input devices and a monitor share between multiple computers

  * 7.1 system; 3.5 mm jacks (color coded)
    * aux line-in (blue)
    * front 2 stereo speakers (green)
    * microphone (pink)
    * two side speakers (gray)
    * two back speakers (black)

## Using expansion slots
  * PCIe expansion slots
  * steps to install expansion cards (graphics, video, network, etc)
    * pick a slot where you won't impede airflow
    * remove the slot cover
    * drop it into your PCIe lane (it doesn't matter if the slot is the same number of lanes, a 1 lane can go into a 16 lane slot for example just fine)
    * screw it down properly to avoid shorting out issues
    * be sure any dongles that came with and power are connected
    * boot it up and go into device manager to check for errors
    * if Windows doesn't see it, you may need to install device drivers
    * sometimes optical media that comes with the card will include software in addition to drivers
    * if issues arise, assume its the expansion card; double check your drivers and check for compatibility

## Intro to Networking
* Local area network
  * Ethernet - was invented to prevent network hogging; sends data in discrete chunks of 1500 bytes (called a frame) 
  * Media Access Control (MAC) address - used to identify and locate each unique computer on a LAN
    * MAC address = 48 bit address expressed as 12 hexadecimal characters (eg. 00-14-2B-01-C3-45)
    * OEM ID = the first 6 characters of the MAC address, assigned by the issuign body of the internet and physically burned into the network card when it is manufactured 
  * every time a frame is sent, the destination MAC address + the source MAC address are included at the beginning, and a frame check sequence (FCS) is included at the end that ensures the data was sent in order

## Hubs vs Switches
* A hub is a repeater, it makes a copy of each frame sent and forwards it to all computers on the network, which then either ignore or accept the frame depending on their MAC address
* A switch is a smart repeater, it keeps track of all the MAC addresses on the network, and makes a direct physical connection between the sender and reciever computers when a frame is sent

## Hexadecimal
*  Hexadecimal is a short hand nomenclature for binary; it is a base 16 counting, which corresponds to the 16 possibilities for a string of 4 binary values (4 bits)
* 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f
* each hexadecimal value = 4 bits

## WANs & Routers
* The Ethernet standard stipulates never putting more than 1024 computers on a LAN; the network would become overloaded well before the 1024 limit (in reality 30-40 computers is the maximum for a standard LAN)
* Wide Area Network (WAN) solves this limitation by using a different addressing system to link LANs together
  * Router - routes traffic between different LAN switches
  * Logical Addressing - identifies different LANs; is assigned by the network administrator or, more commonly, automatically by DHCP
  * IP addressing - the standard form of logical addressing
    * 192.168.4.100 - all computers on a LAN share the same IP address, which is unique and different to that LAN, except for the last number in the address
    * Internet connected LANs will have a Default Gateway Router that connects to a WAN; the default gateway itself has an IP address, conventionally ending in 1 (i.e. 192.168.4.1)
    * Computers use MAC addresses to communicate over a LAN, IP addresses to communicate over a WAN

## Network Cables and Connectors
* Ethernet cables
  * There are thousands of different ethernet standards such as 
    * 10BaseT (10 Mbps baseband twisted pair)
    * 1000BaseT
    * 10GB base T (10 Gbps/s)
  * As these standards came out, different cables needed to be invented to support these speeds
    * Coaxial cable
      * RG ratings
        * RG-58: used to be commonly used in the networking world; used a BNC connector
        * RG-59 and RG-6: used for video and networking; use F-type connectors
    * Twisted pair cable
      * Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) - doesn't have any metal shielding wrapped around it
        * run about 100m
        * RJ-11 connector - old connector used for telephones, had 4 contacts
        * RJ-45 - modern ethernet connector, has 8 contacts to connect 4 twisted pairs
      * Shielded twisted pair (STP) - has metal shielding through the cable that helps prevent interference from things like electric motors and flourescent lights
    * Fiber optic (fiber) cable - uses light instead of electricity; popular for 10 Gbps or faster ethernet; alternative to cable 
      * Multimode = uses LED; for network environments
      * Singlemode = uses lasers; for long distances (kilometers)
      * Typically a fiber optic cable is one way, so you have one for sending and one for recieving
  * CAT (category) ratings (MEMORIZE THESE)
    * CAT 5 - 100 Mbps/s
    * CAT 5e - 1 Gbps/s
    * CAT 6 - 1 Gbps/s up to 100m, or 10 Gbps up to 55m
    * CAT 6a - 10 Gbps/s at 100m
  * Plenum ratings (fire resistance)
    * PVC (non-plenum) - not resistant
    * Riser rating - better than PVC
    * Plenum rating - Best
  
## Crimping Cables
* RJ-45 crimps - also have a CAT rating, make sure to match them up
* TIA 568A/TIA 568B
  * looking at the crimp straight on, pins are numbered 1-8 right to left
  * take an unshielded twisted pair cable, and untwist the 4 color coded pairs
  * T568A
    * 1= white green
    * 2= green
    * 3= white orange
    * 4= blue
    * 5= white blue
    * 6= orange
    * 7= white brown
    * 8= brown
  * T568B
    * 1= white orange
    * 2= orange
    * 3= white green
    * 4= blue
    * 5= white blue
    * 6= green
    * 7= white brown
    * 8= brown
  * put the wires in the RJ-45 crimp, put the crimp in the crimper and squeeze
* if youve got it wired properly it's called a "straight through cable"; if you check the wiremap it should read 12345678 12345678
* Crossover cable = one side is T568A and the other is T568B; useful for plugging in two computers directly without a switch

## Structured Cabling
* Main Distribution Frame (MDF) - the closet where the network equipment is
* Equipment rack - has a patch panel with horizontal runs that connect to the different wall outlets throughout your LAN
* Horizontal run:
  * patch cable runs from switch box to the patch panel; another runs from the patch panel to the wall outlet; another from the outlet to a computer
* 110 punchdown tool
* when testing patch cables you want to do a Continuity Test and a Wire Map test
* Fox (tone generator) and hound (tone probe)
  * used to locate cables, figure out which patch cable is going where in the patch panel
* Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) - uses the speed of light to detect how long a cable is
* There are actually two kinds of unshielded twisted pair cables
  * Solid core - each of the 8 wires is a solid piece of metal
  * Stranded - each of the 8 wires is stranded (used for patch cables, makes them more flexible but at the price of performance)

## TCP/IP
* IP address is composed of 4 Octets: 10.11.12.13
  * each octet can go from 0-255 for a total of 4 billion possible addresses
  * each address
    1. Identifies which LAN you are a part of
    2. Give you a unique host ID
  * This numbering system was known as Tier 1 of the internet
    * Say Rice Univerity (one of the original ARPANET members) was 12
    * Then others in the Houston area such as University of Houston want to join, they would connect through Rice Universities router and be delegated an address like 12.1
    * But University of Houston has lots of different LANs for different buildings/departments, so they would in turn delegate addresses down as the "Network ID" such as 12.1.44, 12.1.27, etc
    * Then the last octet was reserved for individual computers within those LANs such as 12.1.44.72 (from 0-254)
  * These numbers were delegated by the Internet Authorized Numbering Authority (IANA) in blocks of addresses
    * 210.11.12.x = class C block, 254 hosts
    * 172.14.x.x = Class B, 65,534 hosts
    * 6.x.x.x = Class A, millions of hosts
  * All of this was based on the assumption that you are never going to be 4 routers away from the top of the internet
  * remember, IP addresses are made up of 4 characters, three dots, and never end in 0 or 255
* Destination IP and Source IP are added to the frame
* Subnet Mask - looks like: 255.255.255.0; a subnet mask is how a computer determines if a destination address is on the same LAN or not
* Default gateway - by convention is the network address ending in a 1 (10.11.12.1); and is where a computer sends it's message if the destination address is not local
* If you want to put a computer on the internet, you need to give it:
  1. an IP address
  2. a subnet mask
  3. a default gateway
 
## Network IDs and Subnet Masks
* In windows go to Network and Sharing Center (not Device Manager!)
  * right click and select propertiies on the Ethernet card
  * look for Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)
  * enter an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway
  * you have now configured a Static IP Address
* in summary: Manual settings = static IP address

## Special IP Addresses
* Class D-multicast address - 224.x.x.x (all are octets are assigned); used for video presentation software
* Class E-reserved - 240.x.x.x; just reserved, nobody ever uses it
* Private IP addresses
  * Class A that starts with ten, i.e. 10.x.x.x
  * Class B that starts anywhere from 172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x
  * 192.168.x.x
* Loopback IP address = 127.0.0.1
  * simply refers to your own system
* if the internet is ever down, try pinging your router
* windows command prompt> ipconfig /all
* windows command prompt> ping -t

## NAT
* Network Address Translation (NAT)
  * saved us when IPv4 addresses ran out in the late 90s
  * NAT enabled gateway routers (all are now) have an IP address assigned by the internet for communicating with the WAN, but then all computors on that routers LAN have a private 192.168.x.x address
  * NAT replaces outbound private LAN IP addresses with it's own public WAN IP address, and then performs the reverse for responding inbound traffic
  * This cannot be used for web servers because anything inside the LAN is invisible to the internet

## Dynamic IP addressing
* Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server
  * most gateway routers double as a DHCP server these days 
  * automatically assigns IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway when a computer joins the network
* APIPA - automatic private IP addressing; this is a computer's fallback in case it cannot find a DHCP server
  * APIPA will always give 169.254.x.x address by default
    * you can still share printers, files, etc over the LAN with APIPA but you can't reach the internet
    * if you can't reach the internet but you can still print, run ipconfig to check if you have an APIPA address; if so, you have a DHCP server problem!
    * ipconfig /release - will disconnect you from a DHCP server
    * ipconfig /renew - will reconnect you to a DHCP server
* What happens when you right click your network icon and select troubleshoot?
  * disables/re-enables your network card
  * release/renew DHCP
  * queries internet to check if you have a connection
* If you need to still be able to connect to the internet even if DHCP goes down, you can configure an alternative static IP address to be assigned instead of APIPA (under "alternate configuration" in IPv4 Properties)

## IPv6
* IPv4: 172.16.254.1
* IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
  * 8 groups seperated by 7 colons
  * shorthand IPv6 removes any leading zeros:
    * 2001:0000:0000:0001:0000:0000:0000:8a2e = 2001:0:0:1:0:0:0:8a2e = 2001:0:0:1::8a2e
  * IPv6 uses two addresses instead of one for IPv4
    * Link-local address = begins with fe80:0000:0000:0000:[last half auto-generated by the computer]
    * Internet address (global unicast address) - [first half retrieved from the internet by your router]:[last half auto-generated by the computer]
  * Temporary IPv6 addresses - as a security feature many computers can spin up temporary IPv6 addresses for different requests (eg. one for web server, another for FTP, another for VOiP, etc)
* IPv6 Prefix - fixed length at /64 (wax 64 i.e. the first half); subnet mask is needed for IPv4 to tell whether we are making a local or long distance call; IPv6 prefix by contrast simply allows us to talk to upstream routers to get our data to it's destination the fastest

## Port numbers
* Client-Server model
  * servers run software that waits for incoming requests determines how to respond to them
  * user types website name into browser, which then requests that websites web server's actual IP address from a Domain Name System (DNS) provider
  * then client machine sends a request (the data) including it's own IP address and the server's IP address (as part of the metadata)
  * server recieves the request and send it's response (such as a webpage) using the IP address included in the metadada
* port numbers - just as IP addresses get you to the right computer, port numbers get you to the right application
  * ports can be 0-65535
  * as with IP addresses, there will always be a source and destination port number included in the packet metadata
  * for example, an http web server might be "listening" on port 80; and a client might send it's request from port 23,337 (representing a tab in a browser)
  * ports allow multiple applications and browsers to communicate over the internet simultaneously; a single webpage can even open multiple port connections on the client machine
  * Types of ports
    * 0-1023 - Well known ports (reserved for common server applications like http, secure http, ssh, etc)
    * 1024-49,151 - registered ports (e.g. steam games)
    * 49,152-65,535 - ephemeral ports (spun up by the client every time your system makes a request to give the server a port to respond to)
* YOU MUST MEMORIZE ALL PORTS LISTED ON THE CompTIA A+ 1001 objectives

## TCP, UDP and ICMP
* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): connetion-oriented and sends multiple packets
* User Datagram Protocol (UDP): connectionless, sends multiple packets
* Internet Control Message Protocol: connectionless, always sends a single packet (eg. the ping commmand)
* Protocal Data Units (PDUs) - a way of describing different aspects of the chunks of data based on whatever we are interested in at the moment
  * Ethernet frame - IP, MAC, Port, Data, FCS
  * IP packet - MAC, Port, Data
  * TCP segment/UDP datagram - Port, Data

## Understanding DNS
* Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) - must be unique, registered, and assigned to a DNS server
* DNS begins through clusters of superpowerful DNS servers called Root Servers that control one Fully Qualified Domain Name called "."
* Underneath the Root Servers are tens of thousands fo First Level Domains that control .com .edu .gov etc.
* Then you have hundreds of thousands of Second Level Domain servers such as google.com
* Root, First and Second Level DNS servers are considered authoritative servers
* When you request a web-page, that request is sent to a non-authoritative DNS server that is either typed into your computer or assigned by DHCP
  * if your DNS server doesn't know the IP address of your web request, it will send a request to the nearest Root Server, which will respond with the nearest appropriate First Level Domain. The First Level Domain will respond with the IP address of the authoritative Second Level Server that controls the requested domain name. The Second Level Server will respond with the IP address for the website
  * once a webpage has been retrieved, your computer and DNS server will cache a copy of the IP address, so if you or any other computer using the same DNS server requests the same page again, it will be resolved quickly

## Working with DNS
* nslookup - tool built in to most OSes that will answer: Is this particular DNS Server IP Address legitimate and is it working?
  * type in any website into the interactive shell
  * if it returns information with no errors it is a working DNS server
  * `> server 8.8.8.8` changes the DNS server to 8.8.8.8 for the session
* DNS records
  * A Record - www.website.com=192.104.9.12
  * MX record - used by mail servers to send email to the right spot
  * Cname - if there is more than one name for an IP address, you can giveit different names
  * nowadays most DNS servers no longer respond to queries for these sorts of records

## Windows Naming 
* Netbios/netbt - the Windows naming convention; designed for LANs, predates DNS and the most of the modern internet
* Every windows installation is given a name
* Each installation will either be a member of a Workgroup or an Active Directory Domain
* Workgroup - the default and most basic form of network organization; no central administration, no security; for small networks it works fine, for the folks who just want to share a printer or share a folder
* Active Directory Domain - provides central administration and security, hosted on a Windows server; all the computers on the network connect to the Active Directory Domain installed on the Windows Server; for enterprise environments needing central admin and robust security
* Homegroup - the idea was to have an option between the security of AD and the convenience of Workgroups; no longer supported on Windows 10

## Routers
* Routers filter and forward traffic based on IP addresses; they are the tool used to interconnect LANs
* Routing table - a list of the network IP addresses that a router's ports are connected to; if the router is not connected to the destination network of the packet, it sends the packet along through the router's "default gateway" port
* In small office and home environments routers tend to be combined with other devices
  * 2 port router + 4 port switch is common
  * can also be combined with a WAP
* In enterprise environments, these functions are not combined 
* Routers can use DOCSIS (i.e. cable modem), ethernet, other bizarre forms of connections and it will always keep that IP packet together
* Console Port - serial port using RS-232 language 
  * Yost/ Rollover Cable - commonly used connector made famous by Cisco for Console Ports; has what looks like (and technically is a RJ-45 port) on one end and a DB-9 connector on the other to plug into a computer
  * A Console Port allows you to plug a laptop or other device into the router and talk to it using a terminal program such as Putty
  * often used for initial configuration
* SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) router
  * When you initially connect, will probably pass out a DHCP range 192.168.x.x to any computer connected to it's LAN port
  * Will also have a default username and password 
  * When setting up the router, first make sure you have good communication between the router and your computer (no internet connection is necessary at this stage)
    * run ipconfig, make sure you are getting a 192.168.x.x address 
    * if ipconfig returns a 169.254.x.x address (APIPA address) then you know for sure that the router is not passing out DHCP and you need to go into the users manual and find out the router's default IP address and then statically set an IP address that matches the router's range
  * if you type in the router's IP address into the browser, you can access the router settings

## Basic Router Configuration
* SOHO routers are designed to basically work out of the box - this is a bad thing! There are a lot of security and configuration considerations you miss this way
* Network Settings in your router:
  * Internet: Most routers are DHCP clients and are assigned their IP by the upstream connection; if your ISP requires it you may need to set a static IP address for your router; most the time you will set it to dynamic IP and leave it there 
  * LAN: this is a matter of personal choice; you can change your internal networkID of the router on the LAN side to something of your choosing (such as 10.11.12.1)
    * since your router is also a DHCP server for your LAN, if you reset it's LAN facing IP it will reassign DHCP addresses for the entire LAN
    * if this breaks your connection you may have to configure your client machine and change your IP to 10.11.12.[anything but 1]
  * System Tools -> DHCP Server:
    * primary/secondary DNS - allows you to change the default ISP DNS to a DNS of your choosing
  * DHCP Reservations - allows you to reserve an IP address for a specific MAC address; Mike considers this a mistake
  * Time Settings - NTP Server = "network time protocol" server to get the time 
  * System Tools -> Local Management: restrict access to network settings to a specific MAC address, or enable for all LAN devices, or remote (WAN) management (this is a really bad idea, disable remote management)
  * SSID = Service Set ID (the name of your network)

## Advanced Router Config
* Quality of Service (QoS) settings: allows you to define how much bandwith things get based on IP address, MAC address, ports, etc
  * need to know your uplink and downlink speeds (i.e. the speeds you are paying for)
  * allows you to set higher or lower priority
* Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) - the default device discovery protocol
* Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) - another device discovery protocol; enables all devices on the network to see your device (in this case, the router)
* Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) - gives more information, enables device querying such as how much bandwidth and what sort of traffic is being routed

## VLANS
* Virtual Local Area Network - takes one physical switch and virtually turns it into 2 or more completely separate VLANs
* Managed Switch
  * Switches use MAC addresses rather than IP addresses by default, so we need to assign it an IP address (by using DCHP by plugging it into our router) so we can get into the configuration settings
  * an unmanaged switch doesn't have an configuration interface, you just plug everything in and it works
  * pro-tip, if you are having troubles accessing the configuration for a switch via browser (with the DHCP assigned IP), try it on Internet Explorer
* VLAN configuration
  * in the switch settings, go to VLAN configuration -> Advanced -> VLAN Membership
  * Every port is a member of VLAN 1 by default 
  * Under VLAN membership you can assign port numbers for VLAN 2 or 3 and so on
* Troubleshooting:
  * if you plug in a switch and start connecting ports and the devices can't see each other, there is a good chance there are some VLAN settings in place that are the problem
* Port Security
  * enabling port security will make it so no new devices not already connected can join
