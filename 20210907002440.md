# always use shellcheck

Think of everything in Shell language as a string and ALWAYS USE `shellcheck`, (for safety reasons). 

Variables go in qoutes:
```
you@130822bc9ed4:~$ vi name

  1 #!/bin/bash
  2 
  3 name="Tom Bombadil"
  4 echo $name

you@130822bc9ed4:~$ shellcheck name

In name line 4:
echo $name
     ^---^ SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting.

Did you mean: 
echo "$name"

For more information:

you@130822bc9ed4:~$ vi name
you@130822bc9ed4:~$ shellcheck name
```
Here `shellcheck` told me that the variable `$name` needs to be in qoutes (this prevents you from being hacked).
