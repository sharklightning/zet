# variable stomping & debugging

Global variables can be "stomped":
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ vi greeting  

  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 greet() {
  4  name="$1"
  5  another
  6  echo "Hello $name!"
  7 }
  8 
  9 another() {
 10  echo "do something with the same variable name"
 11  name="Sam"
 12 }
 13 
 14 greet Tom
 15 echo "$name"

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greeting 
do something with the same variable name
Hello Sam!
Sam
```
To debug shell code, add `set -x` to the top of your script. 
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 set -x
  ...
```
This will show you every single command of your script as if it were executed from the command line:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greeting 
+ greet Tom
+ name=Tom
+ another
+ echo do something with the same variable name
do something with the same variable name
+ name=Sam
+ echo Hello Sam!
Hello Sam!
+ echo Sam
Sam
```
Using `local` is not a great solution to this problem because all it takes is for you to forget using local in one location and the global variable will stomp it's local counter-parts. 

Bottom line: always assume variables are global in shell and just be careful when naming variables.
