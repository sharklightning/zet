# system calls

    * linux at its core is looking at the world in terms of processes that are running, memory that is being used by those processes, and representing that to the end user as files
    * underneath the hood: when you run a program what it does is send communications to the kernel through system calls
    * you can trace a running process and you can see what system calls its using, how it's communicating with the kernel
        * this allows you to see why a program is messing up, or audit a program to see if it is phoning home to someone malicious on the internet, etc
    * every single programming language tells the kernel what to do using system calls, including opening files, opening network connection, sending data, etc
