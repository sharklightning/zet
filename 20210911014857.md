# parameter expansion bug

Playing around with conditionals I accidentally introduced a parameter expansion related big into my code. Here is what it was.

I wanted to experiment using multiple early returns in a subroutine:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 set -x
  3 
  4 has() {
  5  if ls "$@" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  6   echo yes
  7   return
  8  fi
  9  if which "$@" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
 10    echo yes
 11    return
 12  fi
 13  echo no
 14 }
 15 
 16 has "$@"
```
Presumably `has` would check to see if the argument `"$@"` can be successfully passed and executed using either `ls` or `which`, and if not to output `no`. 

Passing either nothing or gobbly-gook should produce `no`, an existing program or file in the directory should return `yes`.

Running the code as written above fails the no arguments test, with `ls` returning `0` (i.e. true) with no arguments:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./has
+ has
+ ls
+ echo yes
yes
+ return
```
This is because the `if ls $@` accepts any number of arguments, including none, and returns the exit status of `ls`, which as already mentioned returns `0` or true when passed no arguments at all. 

In order to fix this bug so that the script will only return true if passed an existing file or program, we should change `$@` to `$1` throughout:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 set -x
  3 
  4 has() {
  5  if ls "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  6   echo yes
  7   return
  8  fi
  9  if which "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
 10    echo yes
 11    return
 12  fi
 13  echo no
 14 }
 15 
 16 has "$1"

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./has 
+ has 
+ ls 
+ which 
+ echo no
no
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./has something
+ has something
+ ls something
+ echo yes
yes
+ return
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./has gobllygook
+ has gobllygook
+ ls gobllygook
+ which gobllygook
+ echo no
no
```
One final note is to point out that running `shellcheck` on this script shows that `which` is non-posix. Apparently there is a bit of a debate what to replace `which` with, since shellcheck's suggestion `command -v` is not a fuingible replacement for `which`:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ command -v ls
alias ls='ls -h --color=auto'
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ which ls
/usr/bin/ls
```
A possible alternative that came up in discussion is `type -P` but this is inconcistent on some shells like `dash`.
