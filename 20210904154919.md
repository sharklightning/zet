# the command line interpreter

`sh` and `bash` are interpreters, they take commands and interpret these into system calls. The kernel then interprets these system calls into binary, and the binary goes straight to the device. 

an interpreter parses (chops up) the character and symbols of a language according to a set of rules (the syntax), and then turns these parsed items into tokens, and then it applies a syntax tree with a bunch of rules, and converts that into logic (the interpreter has a bunch of logic programmed into it already that it matches to what it is given), and it turns that into calls that it passes along down the line which in this case means sending system calls to the kernel


`sh` is the standard command language interpreter. 

Interpreters translate one language to another. `sh` takes in [Shell Command Language][s] and translates this into system calls that the kernel can understand. 

`sh` first breaks the input into [tokens][t], then `sh` applies a syntax tree to the tokens according to a set of rules, 

At a certain level, all languages are interpreted, but an "interpreted language" is considered to  be a language that is passed to an interpreter rather than being compiled into binary and then run.
