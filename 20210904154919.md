# the command line interpreter

`sh` is the standard command language interpreter. 

Interpreters translate one language to another. `sh` takes in [Shell Command Language][s] and translates this into system calls that the kernel can understand. 

`sh` does this by first breaking the input into [tokens][t], then `sh` applies a syntax tree to these tokens according to a set of rules resulting in a set of logical formulations that can be sent to the kernel as system calls. 

The kernel then interprets these system calls into machine code for the system's devices.
