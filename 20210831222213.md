# usermod

`usermod` modifies a users configuration.\
For example, `newuser` from our last example in "creating users" came with `/bin/sh` as her shell.\
If we want to change this we would:
```
root@a5db6a709628:/# usermod -s /bin/bash newuser
```
which we can confirm by logging into `newuser` and using `echo $SHELL`:
```
root@a5db6a709628:/# su - newuser
newuser@a5db6a709628:~$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
```
