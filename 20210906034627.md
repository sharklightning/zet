# What's up with `#!usr/bin/env` 

You will commonly see scripts that begin with `#!/usr/bin/env`, why?

If our script were a python3 script we can use `which python3` to find where the interpreter is located and set the interpreter for our script accordingly:
```
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ which python3
/usr/bin/python3

rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ vi hey

  1 #!/usr/bin/python3
  2 print("hello")

rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ chmod +x hey
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ ./hey
hello
```

However, if we want to send our script to a friend on macOS for example, their `python3` interpreter might be in `/usr/local/bin/python3`

To deal with this portability issue a lot of programmers use `/usr/bin/env python3`. Normally `env` shows you your current environment but if you put a command after it then `env` will run that command wherever that command is.

This is a hack that the Ruby community came up with but it has all sorts of security problems so you shoudln't use it if you can avoid it, but it's super common so you should know about it.

The only case where you might have to use it is if you are making a script that you know is going to have a really wide distribution and just needs to work on whatever system without modification by the end user. .
