# disambiguation brackets

Best practice when using variables in posix is to use "disambiguation brackets" to distinguish the variable from the crowd:

```
you@130822bc9ed4:~$ vi greet 

  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 greeting="hola"
  3 echo "${greeting}_muchachos"

you@130822bc9ed4:~$ ./greet 
hola_muchachos
```
You shoud really do this anyways and always just to be safe. Always curly bracket your variables. You don't HAVE to, but it's the right thing to do.
