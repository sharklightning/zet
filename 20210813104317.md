# how linux works
### Unix/Linux 
 * the fundamental abstraction/interface: everything is a file (actually, an inode)
   * everything is running as a process; a process is just anything that runs on a computer
   * in order to coordinate between the hardware devices and what the user wants (output), the OS uses the idea of the process
   * see Computer Pioneers and BBC History of Computers on youtube

 * kernel: in charge of coordinating all the hardware attached to the cpu
   * modern programs need to run in a multi-threaded env, meaning using multiple cpu cores independently at the same time
   * kubernetes is an abstraction that directly models the OS for IT 

* research _cpu management, storage, process i/o_
  * a badly written program will hog cpu by only using one core
  * `top` shows resource usage and processes
  * `pwd` - print working directory
