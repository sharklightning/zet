# how linux works
### Unix/Linux 
 * the fundamental abstraction/interface: everything is a file (actually, an inode)
 * everything is running as a process; a process is just anything that runs on a computer
 * in order to coordinate between the hardware devices and what the user wants (output), the OS/kernel uses the idea of the process
 \
 * kernel: in charge of coordinating all the hardware attached to the cpu
    * see Computer Pioneers and BBC History of Computers on youtube
 * modern programs need to run in a multi-threaded env, meaning using multiple cpu cores independently at the same time
 * kubernetes is an abstraction that directly models the OS for IT 
\
* `top` shows resource usage and processes
* research _cpu management, storage, process i/o_
    * a badly written program will hog cpu by only using one core
* `pwd` - print working directory
