# how linux works

* kernel: in charge of coordinating all the hardware attached to the cpu
    * see Computer Pioneers and BBC History of Computers on youtube
* modern programs need to run in a multi-threaded env, meaning using multiple cpu cores independently at the same time
* top (shell command) shows resource usage and processes
* research cpu management, storage, process i/o
    * a badly written program will hog cpu by only using one core
* pwd - print working directory

Unix/Linux 
    * the fundamental abstraction/interface: everything is a file (actually, an inode)
    * everything is running as a process; a process is just anything that runs on a computer
    * in order to coordinate between the hardware devices and what the user wants (output), the OS/kernel uses the idea of the process
    * kubernetes is an abstraction that directly models the OS for IT
