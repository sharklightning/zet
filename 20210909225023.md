# procedure/function calls

Procedures (aka subroutines) or functions are defined first then called:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 say_hello() {
  4  echo "Hello"
  5 }
  6 
  7 say_hi() {
  8  echo "Hi there"
  9 }
 10 
 11 say_hello
 12 say_hi

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greeting 
Hello
Hi there
```
Defining a subroutine `main()` where all your other subroutines and/or functions are called makes it easier to test your code because you can call each one individually and see if it works without executing the rest:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 say_hello() {
  4  echo "Hello"
  5 }
  6 
  7 say_hi() {
  8  echo "Hi there"
  9 }
 10 
 11 main() {
 12  say_hello
 13  say_hi
 14 }
 15 
 16 say_hi

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greeting 
Hi there
```
Another testing technique that you can use in combination with the `main` approach is to add `echo` in front of the commands of your subroutines so that your script prints what will ultimately be executed:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 say_hello() {
  4  echo echo "Hello"
  5 }
  6 
  7 say_hi() {
  8  echo echo "Hi there"
  9 }
 10 
 11 main() {
 12  say_hello
 13  say_hi
 14 }
 15 
 16 main

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greeting 
echo Hello
echo Hi there
```
And then when you are confident that everything works and is safe, you can remove any `echo`s for testing purposes and call `main` at the end of your script:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 say_hello() {
  4  echo "Hello"
  5 }
  6 
  7 say_hi() {
  8  echo "Hi there"
  9 }
 10 
 11 main() {
 12  say_hello
 13  say_hi
 14 }
 15 
 16 main

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greeting 
Hello
Hi there
```
(These are obviously trivial examples but if you are doing something dangerous that is difficult to test, like changing the production namespaces for hundreds of users for example, these techniques can be vital)
