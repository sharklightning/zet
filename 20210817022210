# cli vs terminal

command line interface is entirely REPL based:
  * read - read a command
  * evaluate - perform the calculation 
  * print - output the result
  * loop - repeat (prompt user for another command)
  
Every command line you enter is a line of shell code
  
A terminal is a richer (but still text based) user interface (you can create clickable links, terminal art, etc.)
