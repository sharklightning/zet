# [ ] vs [[ ]]

In posix, `test -e "$1"; then` is the equivalent of `[ -e "$1" ]; then`, however there are reasons why you should always stick to `test` for posix. First, you have to remember to include the correct spaces in `[ ]`, which is annoying. 

More importantly, it is easy to forget that globstar expansion is allowed in `[ ]`, especially since it is not allowed in double bracket notation `[[ ]]` in bash. This can open you up to shell injection vulnerabilities by providing a false sense of safety. 

The solution is to always use `test` for posix code (which you or someone modifying your code is less likely to forget will expand like any other shell command and should be used carefully with qoutes around parameters), and `[[ ]]` interactively at the command line, but never to use `[ ]`.
