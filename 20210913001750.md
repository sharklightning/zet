# short circuit logic

If any condition evaluates to false the chain stops and the evaluation stops happening. 

A very simple short circuit operator would be:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ test -e something && echo "something exists"
something exists
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ test -e gobblygook && echo "something exists"
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ 
```
I.e. test if a file named `something` exists. If it does, print `something exists` to `stdout`. If it doesn't, stop evaluation. 

You will see short circuit logic in dockerfiles all the time. For example (taken from rwxrob/workspace/Dockerfile on Github):
```
RUN yes | unminimize && \
    apt-get -y --no-install-recommends upgrade && \
    apt-get install -y \
        apt-utils \
        build-essential \
        software-properties-common \
        apt-transport-https \
        ca-certificates \
        man-db \
        curl \
        && \
    apt-key adv \
        --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com \
        --recv-key C99B11DEB97541F0 \
        && \
    apt-add-repository https://cli.github.com/packages && \
    add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa && \
    apt-get update -y && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        vim tmux dialog perl python git gh jq sudo lynx shellcheck \
        figlet sl tree nmap ed bc iputils-ping bind9-dnsutils htop \
        libncurses5 libcurses-perl net-tools ssh sshpass sshfs rsync \
        cifs-utils smbclient bash-completion make wget less lolcat\
        && \
    cpan -I Term::Animation && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/* /var/log/dmesg.* && \
    cat /dev/null > /var/log/dmesg
```
Notice all the `&&`s here. This is actually one massive, single line of shell code. If anything along the track fails, you're dead. 

You can use short circuit logic with the "or" operator, `||`, but this doesn't chain as well as the "and" `&&` operator, so it's usually only used to test one simple error (like: test this, or do this).  
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ test -e gobblygook || echo "does not have gobblygook"
does not have gobblygook
```
When doing short circuit logic it's generally best to stick with the `&&` operator.
 
Another way you could write a script using short circuit logic would be to write a series of `test` commands and include `set -e` at the beginning of the script so if any test fails the program short circuits.
