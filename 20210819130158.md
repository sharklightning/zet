# understanding container states and storage

image vs container
  * the image is what ends up running in the container
  * every time you call `run`, docker makes a new running instance of that image as a container 
  * when you `exit` that container, docker pauses/stops the running container processes but automatically saves it's state (all the files that were changed, programs installed, etc)
  * `docker start` brings the container's state back into memory and begins running it's processes again
  * `docker commit` turns a container that is currently off and it's currently saved state into a new image
     * once a container has been saved as an image, it can be saved on disk as a file, shared with others, and/or pushed to a registry like docker, github, or private registries hosted on aws, azure, gcp, etc

dockerfile vs commit
  * there are two ways to make an image: `docker build` and `docker commit`
  * `docker build`
     * creates an image from a dockerfile written in posix shell
     * the essence of devops from the developers perspective is using a container with a consistent environment, and sharing that consistent container environment with everyone else on your team\
     * best practice is to maintain/update your dockerfile as you make changes to your image
       * that way you can use `docker push` to share your image
  * `docker commit`
     * creates a new image based on the state of a saved container
     
 where kubernetes and cloud native infrastructure fits in
  * management of registries and container states, storage, processes, when a container runs and doesn't run -- i.e. container orchestration, is the essence of cloud native infrastructure and is what kubernetes does
