# subroutines and procedures

You can group commands (which are themselves procedures) into subroutinesusing brackets.

Most languages will not distinguish between subroutines and functions, unfortunately. 

Shell consists soley of procedures and subroutines. Shell does not allow you to return values the way javascript did. Shell is mostly about grouping commands together and flow. 

The only return values that Shell provides are 0 or some other integer to indicate whether the procedure succeeded or failed. Anything else has to be passed in some other way. 

We write a shell script that defines and calls a simple subroutine as follows:
```
you@130822bc9ed4:~$ vi hello

  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 say_hello() {
  4 echo "Hello"
  5 echo "how are you?"
  6 }
  7  
  8 say_hello

you@130822bc9ed4:~$ ./hello
Hello
how are you?
```
