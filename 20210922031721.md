# exec

When a process is running there is stuff that's running in memory; the kernel knows what is running in memory. The kernel is handling signals for it, so it can recieve signals. It has a number of resources: every time the process opens a file it locks down the inode that goes with that file and the resource that says "hey, I have this file." 

When a process starts a subprocess, that subprocess has it's own set of memory, signal handlers, files that is has open (file descriptors), etc. When you have a program that is going to run a program like:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 cmd=$(command -v $1)
  3 test -n "$cmd" && exec vi "$cmd"
```
This script simply uses `command -v` to find the path to a command and then opens the command file using `vi` (after testing that the user input `$1` is a non-zero length string)

In this script, `exec vi "$cmd"` does the same thing as `vi "$cmd"` would except that `exec vi "$cmd"` hands off it's memory space to the process that called it rather than starting a subprocess. This way `exec vi "$cmd"` process inherits the environment, any open file descriptors, signal handlers and process ID of the parent process.
