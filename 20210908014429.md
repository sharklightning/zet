# math in posix shell

In keeping with the "treat everything as a string" philosophy, when doing math in posix scripts save yourself the headache and just pass your math as a string to `bc`:

```
you@130822bc9ed4:~$ vi math

  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 echo 'scale=4; 3 / 4' |bc

you@130822bc9ed4:~$ ./math
.750
```

This will save you pain and heartache when you try to do division in posix shell which does not support floating point notation. 

i.e. don't do math in posix shell, pass your math to `bc`
