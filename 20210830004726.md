# read (user input)

`read` prompts for user input:
```
~$ printf "Is that okay? (n)" ; read
Is that okay? (n)
```

you can then store the response in a variable and use it (in this example we will just echo the response to the screen):
```
~$ printf "Is that okay? (n)" ; read resp; echo $resp
Is that okay? (n)yes
yes
```

you can use this for text based storyline games
