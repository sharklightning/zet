# processes

  * when the computer boots it starts the BIOS (basic input/output system), which is a tiny chip with a tiny OS whose sole job is to boot into another OS
  * BIOS is told which device to boot the OS from; BIOS can even load an OS entirely over a network, but usually it boots a OS on local storage
  * the first process that the linux kernel runs is /sbin/init; PID 1; this and all running processes are essentially just looping to do something
  * init then communicates and fires up everything else
  * everything running on your computer has a parent process; init is the parent of all processes
  * when you run a program, it is a process until it dies; when it dies it's memory goes away, so unless something was written to disk it doesn't exist anymore
