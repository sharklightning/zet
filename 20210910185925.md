# Conditionals

Conditional logic and flow in unix relies on exit codes.

## ignoring stuff in posix v. bash

If we want to ignore output and just check the exit status of a command, there is the properly posix way and the interactive `bash` way. It's fine to use the latter on the command line but keep in mind that you should stick to posix for writing scripts. 
 
The properly posix way to ignore stdout and stderr is to send stream 1 to `/dev/null` and redirect stream 2 to stream 1:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ls -l something
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom 0 Sep 10 19:04 something

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ls -l something >/dev/null 2>&1; echo $?
0
```
However, in `bash` and most modern shells you can abbreviate this as:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ls -l something &>/dev/null; echo $?
0
```

## short circuit logic: the `&&` operator
In unix you can treat any command as conditional. `&&` tells shell to check the exit code of the command preceding it, and if it returns true (i.e. if the exit code is `0`) then to execute the command/s folling it. 
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ls -l something &>/dev/null && echo true
true

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ls -l somethng &>/dev/null && echo true
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ 
```

## if, then, else notation
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ if ls -l something &>/dev/null; then echo true; else echo no; fi
true
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ if ls -l somethng &>/dev/null; then echo true; else echo no; fi
no
```

Remember to use posix in scripts!
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ vi has 

  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 if ls "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  4  echo yes
  5 else 
  6   echo no
  7 fi

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ shellcheck has 
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ls
greet  has  something
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./has
no
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./has something
yes
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./has anything
no
```
## return early 
You should (almost) never use `else`, return early instead to avoid crazy nesting and preserve readability:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 has() {
  4  if ls "$@" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  5   echo yes
  6   return
  7  fi
  8  echo no
  9 }
 10 
 11 has "$@"
```
Returning early also has the advantage of being closer to short circuit logic which is more true to how the computer and actual logic gates work.
