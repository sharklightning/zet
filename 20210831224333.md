# modifying permissions

Let's say now that we want to make a home dir for `another`, who we created using `useradd` without the `-m` flag.\
We can navigate to `/home` as root and copy /etc/skel to `another` to create them a home directory:
```
root@918d082cd65b:/# /home
root@918d082cd65b:/home# cp -r /etc/skel another
root@918d082cd65b:/home# su - another
$ ls -la
total 20
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Sep  1 00:44 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Sep  1 00:44 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  220 Sep  1 00:44 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3771 Sep  1 00:44 .bashrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  807 Sep  1 00:44 .profile
```
However, `another` will lack permissions:
```
$ touch something
touch: cannot touch 'something': Permission denied
```
To fix this, we need to return to root and change the owner of the directory:
```
root@918d082cd65b:/home# chown another:another another
root@918d082cd65b:/home# su - another
$ touch file
$ ls
file
``` 

Note that:
```
root@918d082cd65b:/home# chown another:another another
```
is just a shorthand command for:
```
root@918d082cd65b:/home# chown another another; chgrp another another
```

To give `another` permission to access all files and folders in their new home dir we would use the same command recursively:\
```
root@918d082cd65b:/home# chown -R another:another another
```
