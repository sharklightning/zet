# shellcheck

`shellcheck` is a program that checks if your script is posix complaint

for example,
```
mkdir some/long/ass/directory/name
```
works in bash but NOT posix (which is the basis of containers and kubernetes, dockerfiles must be written in posix)

in posix you would have to
```
mkdir some; mkdir some/long; mkdir some/long/ass; mkdir some/long/ass/directory; mkdir some/long/ass/directory/name
```

always use `shellcheck` when writing posix scripts
