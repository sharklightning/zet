# /proc

* `/proc` is a virtual file system; there are no actual files there, `/proc` represents processes that are running as files
* an inode is an [index node](https://linuxhandbook.com/inode-linux/)
     * inode = the metadata, excluding the file name and data itself
     * i.e. size, permission, owner/group, location, date/time, any other info needed
 * `ls /proc` lists the processes that are running, represented as files
 * `pstree` command is actually looking at the `/proc` filesystem 
     * use `pstree | more` for more detailed info
