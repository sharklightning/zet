# posix

portable operating system interface

2 beginner tips:
 1. use `shellcheck` every time to check for posix complaince
 2. use `set -e` at the beginning of every shell script - this will make shell exit the program if anything fails, which is not the case by default
 3. use `touch` to create new files and then get all your permissions set up before using `vi` to edit it - this will prevent you from starting to write a file in a directory where you do not have write permission and losing your work as a consequence. If you make this mistake write to `:w /tmp/foo` as a workaround. 
 4. add `set viminfo='20,<1000,s1000` to your `~/.vimrc` to prevent truncation of yanks, deletes, etc.
