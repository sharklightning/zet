# rtfm (man pages)

rtfm = read the fucking manual

~$ man man: 

  "DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager.  Each
       page argument given to man is  normally
       the name of a program, utility or func-
       tion.  The manual page associated  with
       each  of  these arguments is then found
       and displayed.  A section, if provided,
       will  direct  man  to look only in that
       section of the manual.  The default ac-
       tion  is to search in all of the avail-
       able sections following  a  pre-defined
       order  (see DEFAULTS), and to show only
       the first page found, even if page  ex-
       ists in several sections.
       
       
       The  table below shows the section num-
       bers of  the  manual  followed  by  the
       types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable  programs  or shell com-
           mands
       2   System calls (functions provided by
           the kernel)
       3   Library   calls  (functions  within
           program libraries)
       4   Special  files  (usually  found  in
           /dev)
       5   File  formats and conventions, e.g.
           /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous   (including    macro
           packages   and  conventions),  e.g.
           man(7), groff(7)
       8   System   administration    commands
           (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A  manual page consists of several sec-
       tions.

       Conventional  section   names   include
       NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIP-
       TION,   OPTIONS,    EXIT STATUS,    RE-
       TURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT, FILES,
       VERSIONS, CONFORMING TO,  NOTES,  BUGS,
       EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.


       The  following conventions apply to the
       SYNOPSIS section and can be used  as  a
       guide in other sections.

       bold text          type    exactly   as
                          shown.
       italic text        replace with  appro-
                          priate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments
                          within [ ]  are  op-
                          tional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by
                          | cannot be used to-
                          gether.
       argument ...       argument  is repeat-
                          able.
       [expression] ...   entire       expres-
                          sion within  [  ] is
                          repeatable.

       Exact rendering may vary  depending  on
       the  output  device.  For instance, man
       will usually  not  be  able  to  render
       italics when running in a terminal, and
       will  typically   use   underlined   or
       coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is
       a pattern that should match all  possi-
       ble  invocations.   In some cases it is
       advisable to illustrate several  exclu-
       sive  invocations  as  is  shown in the
       SYNOPSIS section of this manual page."
