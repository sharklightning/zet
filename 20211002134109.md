# schemas & domain modeling

A schema is the structure behind data organization. A schema is the result of domain modeling, which is the process of deciding the rules of how things should be named and organized. 

Schema and types kind of go together, because to define your schema you have to define the types allowed in your schema. 

Schemas can be more or less stricts depending on your requirements. A dictionary of basic key value pairs might allow any new pair to be added at any time. Other schemas might only allow a fixed set of specifically named values. 

You could have key value pairs that contain key value pairs, or not. Etc.

JSON's claim to fame was that it largely codified the most important data types of a universal schema upon which application specific schemas can be built. 

In order for an application to exchange data with others using JSON/YAML, it needs it's own schema so that other applications know what is expected and therefore how to communicate with it. For example if we are exchanging resume data using JSON/YAML and I name a field "occupation" whereas you name that field "profession" then we have a problem. 

You can use JSON/YAML to define your particular schema types of what the data has to be, and then you compare any of the data coming in to see if it matches the schema. 


## schema in relation to APIs and UIs
The schema/domain model defines what stuff is in a system

APIs wrap the schema/domain model of a system and define the procedures that you can request be done with the data. 

A front-end defines the view or user-interface through which a user can interact with a system's schema.
