# Managing Jobs & Processes

A running program is a process. A backgrounded program is a job.

Why would you background a process? You don't want to background a process unless you have a good reason. 

Most of the time you don't need to background a program when you can just use another window. `jobs` was created before `tmux` back when you could only use one terminal window at a time. 

`ctrl-z` stops a process but keeps it open in the background. 
`fg` brings it back to the foreground. 
Adding `&` to the end of a command runs the program as a job in the background. 

`nohup` allows for a process to live when the terminal gets killed. Mostly useful in the context of running a server.

Backgrounding allows you to achieve concurrency and parrellelism using Shell.
