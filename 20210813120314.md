# inter-process communication

in addition to making system calls to communicate with the kernel, processes can communicate with each other in a few ways:

two processes can share the same space in memory and look at the same space in memory (this is the fastest but dangerous)

they can talk to each other through some sort of event system. 
 * the kill command, for example, is a process that uses an event system to end other processes

they can communicate through [sockets][s], which are a special type of file, either locally or through the internet
 * the TCP/IP stack with a server and a client is implemented using sockets

sometimes they will even just write to a file and then the other program will see that the file has been written to and it will grab it and go on
