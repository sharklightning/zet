# Running & Sourcing Scripts

By default (for security reasons), linux/unix forces you to specify the path to an executable in order to run it. `./` tells the shell to run an executable located in the current directory:
```
rtfmtom@boost:~/repos/sharklightning/zet$ ls -l whatdir
-rwxrwxr-x 1 rtfmtom rtfmtom 14 Sep  6 13:41 whatdir
rtfmtom@boost:~/repos/sharklightning/zet$ whatdir
-bash: whatdir: command not found
rtfmtom@boost:~/repos/sharklightning/zet$ ./whatdir 
/home/rtfmtom/repos/sharklightning/zet
```

`whatdir` is just a silly script that just executes `pwd` that I made to illustrate the following point. If you are in a different directory and want to run a script, the script will run from its own directory but in the context of your current directory (you can provide either relative or asbolute path):
```
# relative path
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ ../repos/sharklightning/zet/whatdir
/home/rtfmtom/sandbox

# absolute path
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ /home/rtfmtom/repos/sharklightning/zet/whatdir
/home/rtfmtom/sandbox
```
