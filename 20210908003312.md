# variables in posix

In posix you 
1. cannot leave a space between the `=` when defining variables
2. must use all variables that have been defined, and ...
3. ON PAIN OF DEATH (or your job):

THOU SHALT ALWAYS QUOTE THY VARIABLES IN SHELL

```
you@130822bc9ed4:~$ vi greet 

  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 greeting="hello there!"
  3 echo "$greeting" 
  
you@130822bc9ed4:~$ shellcheck greet
you@130822bc9ed4:~$ ./greet 
hello there! 
```
WHY?? Because non-quoted variables can result in unintended code being executed. The script:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 greeting="-n  hello"
  3 echo $greeting
```
will execute `echo -n hello`, instead of printing "-n hello":
```
you@130822bc9ed4:~$ ./greet
helloyou@130822bc9ed4:~$ 
```
in this case, the `-n` switch merely prevents a breakline at the end of whatever `echo` prints. However, the fact that code can unintentionally be executed using variables this way can end up in a really bad day or worse. 

(There are so many ways to hack shell code by looking through code that does this that runs with privileges.) 

Bottom line: ALWAYS qoute thy variables in shell. 

And use `shellcheck`. 

If you forget to qoute your variables, `shellcheck` will yell at you.
