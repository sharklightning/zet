# more on loops in posix

## don't do math loops in posix
POSIX doesn't support floating point arithmetic, so it's better to use Perl or Python to write scripts that require math loops, unless you know you are only going to need integers. 

A basic `for` loop in POSIX (for when you know how many iterations you want to do):
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 for i in `seq 1 10`; do
  4   echo $i;
  5 done
```
If you don't know the number of iterations before hand you can use a `while` or `until` loop instead:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 foo(){
  4   i="$1"
  5   until test "$i" -gt 10; do
  6   echo "$i"
  7   i=$((i+1))
  8 done
  9   }
 10 
 11 foo "$1"
```
`foo` takes a number from the user and prints each consecutive number until greater than ten. 

Introducing a floating point number breaks `foo`:
```
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:~$ ./foo 5
5
6
7
8
9
10
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:~$ ./foo 5.5
./foo: 5: test: Illegal number: 5.5
5.5
./foo: 7: Illegal number: 5.5
```

## Init, Check, Change
Every loop has 3 phases: init, check, and change. 
 
The initialization phase that sets everything up. This can include setting one or more variables, calling a function, and so on. 

Check is where you test one or more conditions and execute code depending on the boolean value of your condition/s. 

Change is where you update one or more variables before repeating the check phase. 
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 foo(){
  4   i="$1"    #init
  5   while test "$i" -le "$2" -a "$i" -ge "$1"; do   #check ( if $2 > i > $1 ) 
  6   echo "$i"
  7   i=$((i+1))    #change
  8 done
  9   }
 10   
 11 foo "$@"
```
