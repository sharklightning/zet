# career paths

* hacking /cyber
    * half the job is writing reports
    
* infrastructure engineering with cloud native infrastructure
  * this is what rwxrob does
  * spends more time on the command line than most pentesters because they are busy writing reports
  * kubernetes, docker
  * pays really well
  * almost no documentation, no reports, almost entirely on the terminal aside from stand ups
  * dif from devs is that developers are under a lot more pressure to hit deadlines
  * constantly get new challenges; 
      * e.g. today integrate jupiter hub with our infrastructure, tomorrow write a script that reports on how many nodes are in our cluster and what state they are in
      * tons of variety, consistent with the daily activities that you enjoy about hacking

* dev ops can suck if you are writing yaml all day
  * infrastructure engineering and sre might be more fun for a hacker
