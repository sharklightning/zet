# set -e

Including `set -e` at the beginning of a script makes it so that if any line at all resolves to false, the script automatically stops execution. 

To ensure a line always evaluates to true so that the program continues, add `|| true` at the end. You will see this kind of formulation a lot in dockerfiles.

The following script checks to see if there is a directory `$HOME/.local/bin`. If not, it creates that directory. If the directory already exists, it throws away any error output to `/dev/null`, evaluates as true and continues. Then it tests is a file `"$1"`exists. If the file exists, the `test` line returns false and the script aborts. If the file does not exist, the script creates that file. 
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 set -e
  3 
  4 mkdir "$HOME"/.local/bin >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
  5 
  6 has() {
  7  test ! -e "$1"
  8  touch "$1"
  9 }
 10 
 11 has "$1"
```
