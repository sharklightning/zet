# stdout and error redirection

 * redirection changes the destination of a stream
  * `>` redirects stream to a file (either creating a new file or overwriting an existing file)
   * WARNING: `>` is dangerous and can lead to losing your work if not used carefully; `set -o noclobber` to disable ability to overwrite using `>`
  * `>>` redirects stream to append to a file
  * `>|` to force overwrite a file 
  * `tee` to save and pipe (i.e. `tee` will save output to a file and also pass it along)
    * ex. `echo 'scale=2; 2/3 | bc | tee bc.out` creates a file bc.out containing `.66` and also outputs `.66` to stdout (in this case, the terminal)
    

### Example
Both stdout and stderr print to the terminal by default, for example:
```
~$ find / -name '*.md' 
/usr/share/doc/libtasn1-6/README.md
/usr/share/alsa/ucm/README.md
/usr/share/alsa/ucm2/README.md
find: '/root': Permission denied
find: '/var/cache/apt/archives/partial': Permission denied
```
displays both the output stream (1) and the error stream (2) to the terminal. To seperate these streams we can use redirection, for example:
```
~$ find / -name '*.md' > find.out
find: '/root': Permission denied
find: '/var/cache/apt/archives/partial': Permission denied
find: '/var/cache/ldconfig': Permission denied
find: '/var/lib/apt/lists/partial': Permission denied
find: '/proc/tty/driver': Permission denied
find: '/proc/1/task/1/fd': Permission denied
```
redirects stdout to find.out so that only stderr is displayed on the terminal.

Note that technically `> find.out` is the same as `1> find.out` but by convention you can drop file descriptor 1 when redirecting. 

If we want to redirect both streams to seperate files we can execute:
```
~$ find / -name '*.md' > find.out 2 > find.err
~$ ls .
find.out find.err
```
where the `2` indicates stderr.

Finally, if we want to redirect both streams to output to a single file instead of the terminal, we can:
```
~$ find / -name '*.md' > find.both 2>&1
~$ ls .
find.both
```
