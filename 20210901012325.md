# deleting users

`userdel` or `deluser` will delete a user

Let's say we have two users `newuser` and `another` on the system:
```
root@918d082cd65b:~# ls /home
another newuser

root@918d082cd65b:~# grep home /etc/passwd
another:x:1000:1000::/home/another:/bin/sh
newuser:x:1001:1001::/home/newuser:/bin/sh
```
Deleting `another` will remove the user from `/etc/passwd`: 
```
root@918d082cd65b:~# userdel another

root@918d082cd65b:~# grep home /etc/passwd
newuser:x:1001:1001::/home/newuser:/bin/sh
```
but will not delete their home dir:
```
root@918d082cd65b:~# ls /home
another newuser
```
In order to delete `another`'s home dir we need to (be careful with this):
```
rm -rf /home/another
```
