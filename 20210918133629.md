# loops

A posix compliant for loop:
```
for i in `seq 1 10`; do uptime; sleep 1; done
```
Same thing but `bash`
```
for i in {1..10}; do uptime; sleep 1; done
```

`while` repeats while condition is true. 
`while true` for infinite loops.
`sleep` to slow your loop down.
`until` to repeat until condition is true. 
`for` to repeat for sequence or number of items
	* use `seq` notation to stay posix compliant

## using shell loops in vi
By using `!` `!` `bash` on line 3
```
  1 Here is a list from one to ten:
  2 
  3 for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo $i. item; done
```
becomes
