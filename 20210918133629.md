# loops

`while` repeats while condition is true. \
`while true` for infinite loops.\
`sleep` to slow your loop down.\
`until` to repeat until condition is true.
	* the difference between `while` and `until` is that `while` will not execute at all if the initial condition is already untrue, whereas `until` will always execute at least once before stopping 
`for` to repeat for sequence or number of items

Arithmetic for-loops are not POSIX. Use `while` to stay POSIX compliant. 

Otherwise, you can do for-loops in most shells with:
```
for i in `seq 1 10`; do uptime; sleep 1; done
```
Or, the same thing but `bash`:
```
for i in {1..10}; do uptime; sleep 1; done
```

## using shell loops in vi
By using `!` `!` `bash` on line 3
```
  1 Here is a list from one to ten:
  2 
  3 for i in `seq 1 10`; do echo $i. item; done
```
becomes 
```
  1 Here is a list from one to ten:
  2 
  3 1. item
  4 2. item
  5 3. item
  6 4. item
  7 5. item
  8 6. item
  9 7. item
 10 8. item
 11 9. item
 12 10. item
```

This script allows you to comment out lines in vi:
```
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:~$ vi cmt 
  1 #!/bin/bash
  2 
  3 while IFS= read -r line; do
  4   echo "${1-#} $line"
  5 done
``` 
Usage: type the number of lines you want to comment out followed by `!` `!``bash` `cmt`
