# test operator, error handling

## The `test` operator
`if ls "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1; then` can be rewritten using `test` as 
```
# test if a file exists
if test -e "$1"; then

# test if two files exist
if test -e "$1" -a -e "$2"; then
```
Homework: memorize the `test` man-page, it has every possible condition you can imagine and you will use it all the time

## error handling
The intention of the following script is to have a single parameter and test if the file exists:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 has() {
  4  if test -e "$1"; then
  5   echo yes
  6   return
  7  fi
  8  echo no
  9 }
 10 
 11 has "$1"
```
However, there is nothing stopping the user from passing multiple arguments to `has` which will simply be disregarded, resulting in a misleading output:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./has something       
yes
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./has something gobblygook
yes
```
To ensure that only a single argument is given, you can include an error handling test:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 has() {
  4  if test -e "$1"; then
  5   echo yes
  6   return
  7  fi
  8  echo no
  9 }
 10 
 11 if test "$#" -ne 1; then 
 12   # redirect custom error message to stderr
 13   echo "usage: has <path>" >&2
 14   exit 1
 15 fi
 16 
 17 has "$1"

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./has something gobblygook; echo $?
usage: has <path>
1
```
