## stdout, stdin, & stderr

Streams are about sending data in different directions. Everything on a computer is streams of ones and zeros traveling in different directions.

There are three streams that are established when a command is executed. Streams are treated like files, and the associated number is it's file descriptor: 

    0: stdin - accepts text from the terminal by default
    1: stdout - outputs text to the terminal by default
    2: stderr - outputs error text to the terminal by default
    
 The default for each stream can be changed using redirection, covered in zettle [20210821205449](https://github.com/sharklightning/zet/blob/main/20210821205449)
