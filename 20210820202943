# root directory

Is the root of the filesystem tree. Inside root you have:
  * `/bin` - is where the major binaries and anything that runs goes (binary, scripts)
  * `/boot` - is where the linux kernel lives, probably don't want to play around there unless you are doing sysadmin
  * `dev` - is where devices live
    * haxx0rs hide stuff here
