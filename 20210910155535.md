# return values, exit codes, output

## exit codes
Every single shell command (including commands executed inside subroutines) returns an integer known as it's exit code no matter what. If the command was successful it returns a `0`, if it is not successful it returns any number between `1` and `255`. 

Note that shell is different than most languages on this point because almost every language uses zero/negative integers for errors and positive integers to indicate success. 

The following `bash` command sends the output of `ls` to `/dev/null`, which just means to throw the output away and disregard it. `echo $?` shows the exit code of the previous command:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ls -l greet &>/dev/null
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ echo $?
0
```
`0` indicates that the command executed successfully. If we try the same command on a file that doesn't exist the exit code will be a positive integer:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ls -l geet &>/dev/null
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ echo $?
2
```

## return value vs output
An exit code is always the return value of a shell command. Output is considered a side effect, not a return value.  

If you want to cheat and use that data as if it were a return value, you can do so by combining `echo` with subshell notation `$()`. 

`echo` prints a string to standard output. `$()` replaces a command or subroutine with it's output.
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 hello() {
  4  echo "hello to $1 $2"
  5 }
  6 
  7 main() {
  8   # use subshell notation to call hello with all of the arguments that were given to main
  9   echo "Whatever you do, be sure to say $(hello $@)!"
 10 }
 11 
 12 main "$@" 

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greet Tom Bombadil
Whatever you do, be sure to say hello to Tom Bombadil!
```
Note that every time you use subshell notation shell makes a subprocess. This is a reason not to make commands aliases because the alias doesn't exist in the context of a subsprocess.
