# exit codes 

Every single shell command (including commands executed inside subroutines) returns an integer no matter what. If the command was successful it returns a `0`, if it is not successful it returns any number between `1` and `255`. 

Note that shell is different than most languages on this point because almost every language uses zero/negative integers for errors and positive integers to indicate success. 

The following `bash` command sends the output of `ls` to `/dev/null`, which just means to throw the output away and disregard it. `echo $?` shows the exit code of the previous command:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ls -l greet &>/dev/null
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ echo $?
0
```
`0` indicates that the command executed successfully. If we try the same command on a file that doesn't exist the exit code will be a positive integer:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ls -l geet &>/dev/null
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ echo $?
2
```
