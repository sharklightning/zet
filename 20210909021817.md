# global variables & variable stomping

All variable declarations in posix are global. The danger of global variable declarations is that global variables are vulnerable to variable "stomping."

In most programming languages the scope of the `$name` variable in `greet` would be confined to that subroutine/function. In posix that is not the case, a variable that is defined inside a subroutine or function will propogate throughout the code:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ vi greeting 

  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 greet() {
  4  name="$1"
  5  echo "Hello $name!"
  6 }
  7 greet Tom
  8 
  9 echo "$name"

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greeting 
Hello Tom!
Tom
```

Most modern shells (Adh, Dash, Bash) have included a `local` modifier that makes local variable scoping possible, but strictly speaking this is not posix complaint and won't work on all systems:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ vi greeting 

  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 greet() {
  4 local name="$1"
  5  echo "Hello $name!"
  6 }
  7 greet Tom
  8 
  9 echo "$name"

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greeting 
Hello Tom!

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/sh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Jul 18  2019 /usr/bin/sh -> dash

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ shellcheck greeting 

In greeting line 4:
local name="$1"
^--------^ SC2039: In POSIX sh, 'local' is undefined.

For more information:
  https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/SC2039 -- In POSIX sh, 'local' is undefined.
```
As can be seen above, `local` scoping works because I am using `dash` for my shell, but `shellcheck` catches this as non-complaint with posix. 

See this [Stack Overflow][s] discussion for more information and posix compliant workarounds.
