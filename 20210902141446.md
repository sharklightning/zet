# setuid, setgid

What `setuid`, `setgid`, etc. do is to cause a program to run with the permissions of the owner, as if the owner had run it, and not the person who is currently running it. 

Back in the nineties people used to get pwned all the time due to this because you could `chmod +s somescript` on a script owned by root to run it as root. 

Nowadays there are safety gaurds to prevent running scripts as root this way, but you can still make compiled binary programs such as C or Go that use `setuid` so that when they run it's as if root ran them.  

Malicious or poorly designed binary programs running as root can still be a security vulnerability, but at least once a program is compiled the binary can't be arbitrarily changed to, for example, open a root shell, the way a script easily can be.

Pentesting Challenge: get a `setuid` script to do something as root when it is run by somebody who does not have `root` or `sudo` access (this shouldn't be possible and probably isn't)
