# << "Here" Document Operator

`<<` tells any command that accepts stdin to wait for a  specified input and then execute a special purpose code block known as a [*here document*](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html), in generalized form it looks like:
```
COMMAND <<InputComesFromHERE
...
...
...
InputComesFromHERE
```

for example:
```
~$ cat <<END
> some 
> thing 
> END
some 
thing
```
  * note: don't mix up inputs with arguments, some commands such as `echo` and `print` take arguments and not from stdin, so you cannot pipe or redirect stdin to these commands
