# YAML and yq

JSON is great for capturing state and sending data around between computers, but it's hard to maintain as a human and line returns are illegal making it terrible for configuration files. 

For this reason, Docker and Kubernetes have gone with YAML instead. 

`yq` uses `jq` like syntax, and supports the same most common operations, but works with json as well as yaml
```
rtfmtom@boost:~$ yq e .[].name.last data.json
Bombadil
Thorton
```
The reason this works is because yaml is a superset of json; json is yaml. Yaml includes json, plus more. 
```
rtfmtom@boost:~$ mv data.json data.yml

rtfmtom@boost:~$ yq e '.[]' data.yml
{"name": {"first": "Tom", "last": "Bombadil"}}
{"name": {"first": "Billy Bob", "last": "Thorton"}}

rtfmtom@boost:~$ yq e '.[].name.last' data.yml 
Bombadil
Thorton
```
Yaml formatted data looks like:
```
rtfmtom@boost:~$ vi data.yml

- name:
        first: Tom
        last: Bombadil
- name:
        first: Billy Bob
        last: Thorton

rtfmtom@boost:~$ yq e '.[]' data.yml
name:
  first: Tom
  last: Bombadil
name:
  first: Billy Bob
  last: Thorton
```
Note that the indentations matter in yaml.
