# path environment variable

The `path` environment variable makes running scripts easier by providing a way to find and execute scripts without having to type out the path to that script every time. 

Your `path` defines all the directories into which you put an executable script or program that will run if it is found, in order of priority. 

To show your `path`:
```
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/usr/local/go/bin
```

To show `path` in a more useful format (this is called a parameter expansion):
```
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ echo -e "${PATH//:/\\n}"
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/bin
/usr/games
/usr/local/games
/snap/bin
/usr/local/go/bin
```

If I move my script into any folder in my `path` I can execute that script from anywhere without explicitly typing out the path to the executable:
```
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ sudo mv ../repos/sharklightning/zet/whatdir /usr/local/bin
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ whatdir
/home/rtfmtom/sandbox
```

Never place `./` in your `path`, this is a security vulnerability as it opens you up to path exploits. If `./` is in your `path`, your shell will prioritize whatever program is in the current directory first. 

That means if `./` were in your `path` a hacker could rename a malicious script `ls` or `passwd`, and when the user uses that command it will execute the malicious script rather than the system version. It is trivial to have the script appear to execute the normal command after doing something malicious:
```
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ export PATH="./:$PATH"
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ echo -e "${PATH//:/\\n}"
./
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/bin
/usr/games
/usr/local/games
/snap/bin
/usr/local/go/bin

rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ vi malicious 

  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 echo "something malicious here, then"
  3 exec /usr/bin/passwd "$@"

rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ chmod +x malicious
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ mv malicious passwd
rtfmtom@boost:~/sandbox$ passwd
something malicious here, then
Changing password for rtfmtom.
Current password: 
```

Using '#!/usr/bin/env' in scripts to declare the interpreter is dangerous for the same reasons. The safest way to write scripts is to just always use the absolute path when indicating the interpreter.
