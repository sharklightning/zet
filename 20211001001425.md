# JSON is for Parsing, Not People

JSON is the lingua franca of web based applications communication(APIs). It was invented to simplify data echange.

JSON was made and optimized specifically for parsing, not for human readability. JSON is the fastest human readable language for parsing on planet earth (i.e. leaving aside parsing languages like Protobuf that exchange binary). 

JSON accepts strings, numbers (numbers either integer or floating point), booleans, arrays (aka vector, sequence), and objects (aka map, hashmap, associative array, dictionary - it's like a miniature database). There is also a null type in JSON. 
```
# this is not JSON formatted data this just to show what data types JSON objects can store:
  1 # string
  2 "Tom"
  3 
  4 # number
  5 53
  6 3.14159
  7 
  8 # boolean
  9 true
 10 
 11 # array
 12 ["Jim,"Bill"]
 13 
 14 #  object (key: value,)
 15 {
 16   "name": "Tom",
 17   "age": 30,
 18   "PI": 3.14159,
 19   "likes-pie": true,
 20   "girlfriend": null
 21 }
```

One issue with JSON is that you cannot do line returns in an object. The following object is illegal in JSON:
```
  1 {
  2   "life_story": "asljkgkjhgsa
  3   aslkjgdljkdfslkgsa
  4   sldakjflaskjfsalkslsllllskdh"
  5 }
```
If you wanted to do this you have to use `\n` and put everything on one line.

Usually a JSON object won't be formatted nicely but will look like something this:
```
{"name":"Tom","age":30,"PI":3.14159,:"likes_pie":true,"life_story":"slkjfgsdkjflkekfhg\njdkljfk\nslkaslkjahb skskjdkdkf\nslkjlkjskdhjkjlkjlsahjksjahs\nskjlfkjlkkjglksdfgjhajhgkjh","girlfriend":null}
```
