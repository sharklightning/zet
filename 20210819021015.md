# manage background and foreground processes 

  * `ctrl-z` runs a process in the background
  * `fg` foregrounds a running process
  
  * to deliberately run a program in the background from the command line place an & at the end:
    * `while true; do printf "$(rndcolor)hello"; sleep 0.5; done &`
    * to kill this process you have to `fg` first to bring it to the foreground, and then `ctrl-c` to interrupt
