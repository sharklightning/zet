# Pattern Matching (Globbing, Globstar)

Globbing is a way to grab a lot of things (mostly in interactive bash shell - not POSIX)

`ls *.md` - list any file ending in `.md` (known as a globstar)\
`ls **/*.md` - recursively list any file ending in `.md` (known as globstar expans\ion)\
`ls *.????` - list any file with a four character extension\
`ls -d **/*.json` - recursively list all files ending in JSON (`-d` is to list directories themselves, not their contents)\
`ls -d **/*.{md,txt}` - recursively list all files ending in `.md` and `.txt`\
`ls -d [^.]*` - list all files that do not begin with a `.` (i.e. not hidden)\
`ls -d [^.]**.* - list all files that have an extension that are not hidden
```
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:~$ ls -d -1 [^.]*
bar
cmt
data.json
examples
foo
foo.html
foo.md
foo.txt
list
people.json
people.yml
repos
some-thing
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:~$ ls -d -1 [^.]**.*
data.json
foo.html
foo.md
foo.txt
people.json
people.yml
```

If you're doing a for-loop and you want to skip hidden files:
```
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:~$ for i in [^.]*; do echo $i; done
bar
cmt
data.json
examples
foo
foo.html
foo.md
foo.txt
list
people.json
people.yml
repos
some-thing
```

Create multiple files:
```
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95$ touch foo.{md,txt,html}
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95$ ls
foo.html  foo.md  foo.txt
```
or 
```
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:examples$ touch foo{01..10}.md
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:examples$ ls
foo01.md  foo02.md  foo03.md  foo04.md  foo05.md  foo06.md  foo07.md  foo08.md  foo09.md  foo10.md
```
 
Loop using a glob:
```
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:~$ for i in **/*.{md,txt}; do echo "do something to $i"; done
do something to .config/lynx/README.md
do something to .local/bin/scripts/README.md
do something to .vimplugins/gruvbox/CHANGELOG.md
do something to .vimplugins/gruvbox/README.md
do something to .vimplugins/vim-go/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md
do something to .vimplugins/vim-go/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
do something to .vimplugins/vim-go/CHANGELOG.md
do something to .vimplugins/vim-go/README.md
...
```

## Don't do glob expansion in scripts
Glob expansion (such as `**`) is not POSIX. 

In general, for scripts use `find` and `seq` instead. 

For example `find . -name '*.md'` is equivalent to `ls **/*.md` but you need to have globstar option enabled in your shell congifuration. 

It's almost always safer to do a `find` iteration or open up the directory and iterate over it. 

Another limitation of globbing (especially important for enterprise grade scripts) is that it stops after a certain number of matches.
