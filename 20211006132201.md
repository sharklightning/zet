# Pattern Matching (Globbing)

## Globbing
Globbing is a way to grab a lot of things (mostly in interactive bash shell - not POSIX)

`ls *.md` - list any file ending in `.md` (known as a globstar)
`ls **/*.md` - recursively list any file ending in `.md` (known as globstar expansion)
`ls *.????` - list any file with a four character extension
`ls -d **/*.json` - recursively list all files ending in JSON (`-d` is to list directories themselves, not their contents)
`ls -d **/*.{md,txt}` - recursively list all files ending in `.md` and `.txt`

You can create multiple files:
```
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95$ touch foo.{md,txt,html}
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95$ ls
foo.html  foo.md  foo.txt
```
or 
```
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:examples$ touch foo{01..10}.md
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:examples$ ls
foo01.md  foo02.md  foo03.md  foo04.md  foo05.md  foo06.md  foo07.md  foo08.md  foo09.md  foo10.md
```
 
Globbing is often used in loops:
```
rtfmtom@22c8cdee6d95:~$ for i in **/*.{md,txt}; do echo "do something to $i"; done
do something to .config/lynx/README.md
do something to .local/bin/scripts/README.md
do something to .vimplugins/gruvbox/CHANGELOG.md
do something to .vimplugins/gruvbox/README.md
do something to .vimplugins/vim-go/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md
do something to .vimplugins/vim-go/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
do something to .vimplugins/vim-go/CHANGELOG.md
do something to .vimplugins/vim-go/README.md
...
```

## Don't do glob expansion in scripts
Glob expansion (such as `**`) is not POSIX. 

In general, for scripts use `find` and `seq` instead. 

For example `find . -name '*.md'` is equivalent to `ls **/*.md` but you need to have globstar option enabled in your shell congifuration. 

It's almost always safer to do a `find` iteration or open up the directory and iterate over it. 

Another limitation of globbing (especially important for enterprise grade scripts) is that it stops after a certain number of matches.
