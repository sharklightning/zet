# pipes and pipelines

A pipe gives you the ability to turn the standard output of one program into the standard input of another 

Pipe the output of `echo` as the input of `bc`:
```
~$ echo '4 + 5' | bc
9
```

Pipe the output of `grep` to `more` to see all the headers in a markdown file
``` 
~$ grep '#' README.md | more
# header one
## header two
## header three
```

Pipe the output of `grep` and transform it using `sed` 
```
~$ grep '#' README.md | sed 's/\#*//' | more
 header one
 header two
 header three
