# passing arguments

Most of programming is about getting different pieces of code to communicate with each other. 

The first way for code to communicate is to call another subroutine or function from another, such as calling subroutines from `main`. Unlike most languages, in shell subroutine/function calls MUST come after they are declared. 

The second way is to pass on some data as an argument.
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 hello() {
  4  echo "Hello $1 $2"
  5 }
  6 
  7 main() {
  8  hello "$1" "$2"
  9 }
 10 
 11 main "Tom" "Bombadil"
```
Assigning parameters to variables in your subroutine can help with readability in larger scripts:
```
  hi() {
    first="$1"
    last="$2"
    echo "Hi there $first $last"
  }
```
Instead of hardcoding the arguments we want to pass in into our script, we can use the special parameter `"$@"`. `"$@"` is the same as saying `"$1" "$2" ...` and so on in order, and allows us to pass in arguments from the command line:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 hello() {
  4  echo "Hello $1 $2"
  5 }
  6 
  7 main() {
  8  hello "$1" "$2"
  9 }
 10 
 11 main "$@" 

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greet 
Hello  
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greet Tom
Hello Tom 
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greet Tom Bombadil
Hello Tom Bombadil
```
The special parameter `"$*"` is equal to `"$1 $2" ...`. Note the difference:
```
  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 hello() {
  4  echo "Hello first: $1 last: $2"
  5 }
  6 
  7 main() {
  8  hello "$1" "$2"
  9 }
 10 
 11 main "$*" 

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greet Tom Bombadil
Hello first: Tom Bombadil last: 
```
