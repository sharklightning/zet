rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ vi greeting 

  1 #!/bin/sh

  3 greet() {
  4  name="Tom"
  5  echo "Hello $name!"
  6 }
  7 greet

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greeting 
Hello Tom!
```

To pass an argument into greet, you can use `$1` which is the first positional parameter:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ vi greeting 

  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 greet() {
  4  name="$1"
  5  echo "Hello $name!"
  6 }
  7 greet Tom

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greeting 
Hello Tom!
```

If you are curious, `$0` contains the name of what was used to execute the script:
```
rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ vi greeting 

  1 #!/bin/sh
  2 
  3 greet() {
  4  echo "Here is \$0: $0"
  5 }
  6 greet

rtfmtom@420195855c10:~$ ./greeting 
Here is $0: ./greeting
```
