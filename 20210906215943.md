# functions vs procedures

Difference between a function and a procedure?
- a function always returns a value but a procedure does not necessarily
- a procedure says: if this, do that; it is a list of instructions
- a function says: pass me an argument and I will return to you a value
- a procedure is designed to affect things outside of itself; what is important about a procedure is all the stuff that it cuases to happen, it's side effects
- a function is like a black box, it is entirely self-contained; you put stuff in, you get stuff out

Why care? You will be a better programmer if you think about your code and organize it from the beginner into either procedures or functions.

From day one, ask yourself, does this bit of code under a procedure or a function? Think about: how would I test this code?

You can write code that will check your function. To test a procedure, you have to test all of it's possible side effects. 

The reason why containers are so important for developers is that they allow you to test side effects in a safe environment.
