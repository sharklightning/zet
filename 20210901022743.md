# /etc/shadow

Once upon a time the `:x:` in `/etc/passwd` contained plaintext passwords:
```
rtfmtom@918d082cd65b:~$ grep home /etc/passwd
rtfmtom:x:1000:1000:Tom Bombadil,,,:/home/rtfmtom:/bin/bash
```
Now user passwords are hashed and stored in a file called `/etc/shadow` that only `root` can access

If an attacker gains access to `/etc/shadow` it is not hard to run the hashed passwords against a guessing program like jacktheripper (or any other number of brute force guessing programs) and crack them, especially if they rent super computing power from a cloud provider for 10 minutes, and then come back and gain root privileges to your system
